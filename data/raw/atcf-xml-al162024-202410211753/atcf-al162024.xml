DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Oscar was 
located near latitude 20.6 North, longitude 75.8 West.  Oscar is now 
moving toward the northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h).  A turn to the 
north is expected this afternoon, followed by a faster northeastward 
motion on Tuesday and Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center 
of Oscar is expected to emerge off the northern coast of Cuba this 
afternoon or evening and move near the southeastern and central 
Bahamas on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some additional weakening is possible while the center remains over 
land today, followed by slight restrengthening after the center 
moves back over water and near the southeastern and central Bahamas 
on Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km) 
from the center.  An ASOS weather station in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba 
recently reported a wind gust of 45 mph (72 km/h). 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).

Guantanamo.
 
Across the southeastern Bahamas, 3 to 5 inches are expected, with

localized flash flooding.
