DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM CST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane John was located
near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 103.0 West. John is moving
toward the northwest near 3 mph (5 km/h) and this motion is expected
to continue through the next day or so. On the forecast track, the
center of John is forecast to approach and move along the coast of
southwestern Mexico or just inland later tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts. John is expected to remain a hurricane until the center 
reaches the coast tonight.  John is forecast to begin weakening 
quickly on Friday as the center moves along the coast or just 
inland.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Through Friday, Hurricane John is expected to produce
additional rainfall amounts of 10 to 20 inches across portions of
the Mexican States of Guerrero and Michoac√°n. Additional rainfall of
2 to 4 inches with locally up to 6 inches is expected across the
Mexican States of Colima and western Oaxaca.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with John,
please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding near and to the east of where the center makes landfall.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected along the coast within the
Hurricane Warning area later tonight into early Friday. Winds to
tropical storm strength are already ongoing along the coast and will
continue to spread inland. Wind speeds atop and on the windward
sides of hills and mountains are often up to 30 percent stronger
than the near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and in some
elevated locations could be even greater.

Hurricane conditions are possible within the Hurricane Watch area 
on Friday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are currently occurring over portions of
the coast within the Tropical Storm Warning area, and should
continue through the night.
 
SURF: Swells associated with John are forecast to continue to
affect the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico through the
week, with the potential for dangerous surf and rip currents.
Please see local statements for more information.
