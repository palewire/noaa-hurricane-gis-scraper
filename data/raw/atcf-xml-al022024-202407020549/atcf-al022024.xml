DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 14.2 North, longitude 65.8 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 22 mph (35 km/h). Beryl is forecast
to continue moving rapidly west-northwestward during the next couple
of days. On the forecast track, the center of Beryl will move
quickly across the southeastern and central Caribbean Sea today
and is forecast to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday.
 
Recent data from the NOAA Hurricane Hunters indicate that the 
maximum sustained winds have increased to near 165 mph (270 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Beryl is a category 5 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Fluctuations in strength are 
likely during the next day or so, but Beryl is expected to still be 
near major hurricane intensity as its moves into the central 
Caribbean and passes near Jamaica on Wednesday.  Additional 
weakening is expected thereafter, though Beryl is forecast to 
remain a hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125
miles (205 km).
 
The minimum central pressure is estimated to be 935 mb (27.61 
inches) based on the NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast on
Jamaica within the warning area on Wednesday.  Winds are expected to
first reach tropical storm strength early on Wednesday, making
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along the
south coast of Hispaniola later today.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3
to 5 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the immediate coast of Jamaica.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
ground level in areas of onshore winds along the southern coast of
Hispaniola.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 
4 to 8 inches, with localized maxima of 12 inches, in portions of 
Jamaica on Wednesday. This rainfall may cause flash flooding in 
vulnerable areas. Rainfall from outer bands of Beryl may impact 
portions of Hispaniola today into Wednesday, with 2 to 6 inches of 
rain possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl will continue across the 
Windward and southern Leeward Islands during the next couple of 
days. Swells are also expected to reach the southern coasts of 
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola later today. These swells are expected to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
