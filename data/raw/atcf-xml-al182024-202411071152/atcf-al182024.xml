DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM EST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was located 
near latitude 24.3 North, longitude 84.9 West. Rafael is moving 
toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A turn toward the west at 
a slower forward speed is expected later today, with this general 
motion continuing through Saturday. On the forecast track, Rafael is 
expected to move over the southern Gulf of Mexico for the next few 
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some weakening is anticipated during the next few days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on aircraft data is 
970 mb (28.64 inches).

RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are expected
today, leading to storm total accumulations of 12 inches across
portions of western Cuba. This may lead to areas of flash flooding
and mudslides, especially along the higher terrain.

of the Gulf of Mexico from east to west during the next several
days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
