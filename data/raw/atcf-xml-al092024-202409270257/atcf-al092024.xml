A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline. For
a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.  Persons
located within these areas should take all necessary actions to
protect life and property from rising water and the potential for
other dangerous conditions.  Promptly follow evacuation and other
instructions from local officials.
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Helene was
located near latitude 29.9 North, longitude 83.9 West. Helene is
moving toward the north-northeast near 24 mph (39 km/h).  A turn
toward the north is expected overnight, taking the center over
Georgia.  The center of the hurricane should make landfall
very soon in the Big Bend region of Florida.  After landfall,
Helene is expected to turn northwestward and slow down over the
Tennessee Valley on Friday and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Helene is an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane on 
the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is expected 
after Helene moves inland, but the fast forward speed will allow 
strong, damaging winds, especially in gusts, to penetrate well 
inland across the southeastern United States, including over the 
higher terrain of the southern Appalachians.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310 miles
(500 km).  A sustained wind of 64 mph (103 km/h) with a gust to 84 
mph (135 km/h) was recently reported at Cedar Key, Florida.   A 
gust of 83 mph (134 km/h) was recently reported at Steinhatchee, 
Florida.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 938 mb (27.70 inches).

A NOAA National Ocean Service tide gauge located on Cedar Key 
recently reported a water level of 7.33 feet above mean higher high 
water.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Carrabelle, FL to Suwannee River, FL...15-20 ft
Apalachicola, FL to Carrabelle, FL...10-15 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...10-15 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...8-12 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Apalachicola, FL...6-10 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...5-8 ft
Tampa Bay...5-8 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...4-7 ft
East of Mexico Beach, FL to Indian Pass, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Charlotte Harbor...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are occurring within the hurricane
warning area.  When the eye passes over, people are reminded to not
venture out into the relative calm, as hazardous winds will increase
very quickly when the eye passes.  Tropical storm conditions are
occurring in southern and central Florida, and these conditions will
continue spreading northward across the tropical storm warning
areas in  the Southeastern U.S. through early Friday.  Strong,
damaging winds,  especially in gusts, will likely penetrate as far
inland as the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians.
 
RAINFALL: Over portions of the Southeastern U.S. into the Southern
Appalachians, Helene is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 6 to 12 inches, with isolated totals around 20 inches. This
rainfall will likely result in catastrophic and potentially
life-threatening flash and urban flooding, along with significant
river flooding. Numerous significant landslides are expected in
steep terrain across the southern Appalachians.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated
this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the
WMO header ACUS44 KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: The risk for several tornadoes continues tonight through
early Friday morning over parts of north/central Florida, Georgia,
South Carolina, and southern North Carolina. The tornado risk will
persist Friday across the Carolinas and southern Virginia.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect much of Florida and
the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas during the next couple of
days.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
