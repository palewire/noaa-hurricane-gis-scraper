DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 11.0 North, longitude 91.5 West. Pilar is
moving toward the east-northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h) and a continued
slow east-northeastward motion is expected during the next day or
two. On the forecast track, Pilar could be near the coast of El
Salvador Tuesday through early Wednesday, though the core of the
system is expected to remain offshore.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Strengthening is expected during the next day or 
so, and Pilar could be near hurricane strength on Tuesday.  
Weakening is expected to begin by Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, in and near the Pacific
coast of Central America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica
through Wednesday.  This rainfall will produce flash and urban
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to reach portions of
the Pacific coast of Central America later today. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical
Storm Watch area early Tuesday.
