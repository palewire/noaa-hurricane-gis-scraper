DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Beryl was located 
near latitude 12.0 North, longitude 60.5 West. Beryl is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h). A continued quick 
westward to west-northwestward motion is expected during the next 
few days. On the forecast track, the center of Beryl is expected to 
move across the Windward Islands this morning and across the 
southeastern and central Caribbean Sea late today through Wednesday.
 
Data from the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicate that 
maximum sustained winds have increased to near 130 mph (215 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Beryl is a category 4 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Fluctuations in strength are 
likely during the next day or so, but Beryl is expected to remain an 
extremely dangerous major hurricane as its core moves through the 
Windward Islands into the eastern Caribbean. Some weakening is 
expected in the central Caribbean by midweek, though Beryl is 
forecast to remain a hurricane.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125
miles (205 km).  Grantley Adams International Airport on Barbados
recently reported sustained winds of 47 mph (76 km/h) with a gust to
69 mph (111 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 
959 mb (28.32 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area beginning early this morning. Potentially catastrophic wind
damage is expected where the core of Beryl moves through portions of
the Windward Islands, with the highest risk of the core in St.
Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada.
 
Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains
are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be
even greater.
 
Tropical storm conditions are occurring or imminent in the tropical 
storm warning area.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
starting this morning for Dominica, and by Tuesday afternoon for
parts of the southern coast of Hispaniola.
 
STORM SURGE:  A life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels
by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of
onshore winds near where the eye makes landfall in the hurricane
warning area. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Hurricane Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of
3 to 6 inches across Barbados and the Windward Islands through this
afternoon. Localized maxima of 10 inches are possible, especially in
the Grenadines and Grenada. This rainfall may cause flash flooding
in vulnerable areas.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are expected across the 
Windward and southern Leeward Islands during the next couple of 
days. Swells are also expected to reach the southern coasts of 
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola in the next day or so. These swells are 
expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. 
Please consult products from your local weather office.
