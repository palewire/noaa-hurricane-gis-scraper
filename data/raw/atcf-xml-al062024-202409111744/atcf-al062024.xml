DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Francine was 
located near latitude 28.6 North, longitude 92.1 West. Francine is 
moving toward the northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h). This general 
motion should continue through this afternoon, and Francine is 
anticipated to make landfall in Louisiana within the warning area 
later this afternoon or this evening. After landfall, the center is 
expected to cross southeastern Louisiana tonight, then move 
northward across Mississippi on Thursday and Thursday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected before landfall. 
Francine is expected to rapidly weaken after landfall, and the 
system is forecast to become post-tropical on Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km). An oil platform east of the center recently
reported sustained winds of 83 mph (134 km/h) and a peak gust of   
102 mph (164 km/h) at an elevation of 102 ft (31 m).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 976 mb (28.82 inches).  
The oil platform with the winds reported above also reported a 
pressure of 983.3 mb (29.04 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Francine can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header
WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane 
warning area in the next few hours, with tropical storm conditions 
ongoing. Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch 
area later this afternoon and tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along 
the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama this afternoon and
tonight.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to
8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across southeastern
Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama and the Florida
Panhandle through Thursday night. This rainfall could lead to
considerable flash, urban and river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.  

For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated 
this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS1 with the 
WMO header ACUS41 KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Intracoastal City, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
Mouth of the Pearl River, LA to Ocean Springs, MS...4-6 ft
Lake Pontchartrain...4-6 ft
Ocean Springs, MS to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft
Cameron, LA to Intracoastal City, LA...3-5 ft
Lake Maurepas...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible this afternoon and tonight 
across parts of southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern 
Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting much of the
northern and northwestern Gulf Coast, likely causing
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
