DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was 
located near latitude 12.0 North, longitude 89.6 West. Pilar is 
drifting toward the northwest near 2 mph (4 km/h). Pilar is forecast 
to turn westward later today and then accelerate west-southwestward 
through Friday. On the forecast track, Pilar may remain in close 
proximity to the coast of Central America through this morning, but 
the core of the storm is expected to remain offshore.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Little change in strength is anticipated over the next day or so, 
followed by gradual weakening.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km) 
from the center. A wind gust of 36 mph (57 km/h) was recently 
reported at the El Salvador International Airport.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone 
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC 
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to 
10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, for portions of Central 
America from southern El Salvador, across southern Honduras, western 
Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica through today. This rainfall will 
produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of 
higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting 
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next couple of days. 
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather 
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the Tropical
Storm Watch area through this morning.
