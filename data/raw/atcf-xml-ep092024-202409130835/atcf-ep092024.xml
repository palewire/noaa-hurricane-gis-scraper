DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ileana was 
located near latitude 21.5 North, longitude 108.9 West. Ileana is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A slower 
north-northwestward to northward motion is expected during the next 
few days. On the forecast track, Ileana is expected to move across 
the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula today and over 
the Gulf of California this weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Little change in strength is forecast before Ileana reaches the Baja 
California peninsula. Weakening is expected over the weekend, and 
Ileana is forecast to dissipate by early Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ileana can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC.

RAINFALL: Through this weekend, Tropical Storm Ileana may produce 
rainfall of 4 to 6 inches, with localized higher amounts up to 8 
inches, across southern Baja California Sur. For northwest coastal 
Sinaloa, Tropical Storm Ileana may result between 6 to 8 inches with 
localized higher amounts up to 12 inches. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Ileana, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall 
Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast of the southern Baja California Peninsula within the warning
area this morning. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the
watch area by early Saturday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ileana will affect portions of the coast
of west-central Mexico and the coast of the southern Baja California
Peninsula during the next couple of days. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
