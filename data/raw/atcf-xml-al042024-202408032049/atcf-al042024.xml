DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located near latitude 23.9 North, longitude 83.2 West. Debby is
moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h).  This motion is
expected to continue tonight, followed by a northward turn on
Sunday and a slower northeastward motion Sunday night and Monday.
On the forecast track, the center of Debby will move across the
southeastern and eastern Gulf of Mexico tonight and Sunday,
reaching the Florida Gulf coast late Sunday night or Monday.
 
Surface observations from the Florida Keys and ships in the
Straits of Florida indicate that maximum sustained winds are near
40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.  Strengthening is expected as
Debby crosses the Gulf of Mexico, and the system is likely to be at
or near hurricane strength when it reaches the Florida Gulf coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone 
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area by late Sunday night or Monday morning, with tropical storm
conditions expected to arrive during the day on Sunday.  Hurricane
conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area by Sunday night,
with tropical storm conditions expected to begin on Sunday. 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread northward over the 
tropical storm warning areas this evening and continuing through 
Sunday. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in
the Florida Keys tonight, and in the Florida Panhandle by late
Sunday or Monday morning.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Yankeetown, FL to  Aucilla River, FL ...4-7 ft
Aripeka, FL to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
Aucilla River, FL to Indian Pass, FL...3-5 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Aripeka, FL...2-4 ft
Tampa Bay...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Debby is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 6 to 12 inches, with maximum rainfall totals up to 18
inches, across portions of Florida and along the Southeast U.S.
coast this weekend through Thursday. This rainfall will likely
result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with
significant river flooding expected.
 
For Cuba, rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches, with localized higher 
amounts, will be possible through tonight. This will result in 
isolated to scattered areas of flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Debby, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two is possible across the Florida Keys and
the western Florida Peninsula through tonight, expanding across much
of northern and central Florida on Sunday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the 
Gulf coast of Florida tonight through Monday and along the Southeast 
U.S. coast early next week. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
