For storm information specific to your area in the United States,

products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast 
office. For storm information specific to your area outside of the 
United States, please monitor products issued by your national 
meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alberto was 
estimated from Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft data near 
latitude 21.7 North, longitude 95.6 West. Alberto is moving toward 
the west-southwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), but a westward motion is 
expected to resume soon and continue for the next day or so.  On 
this track, the center of Alberto is expected to reach the Gulf 
coast of Mexico early Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some slight strengthening is possible tonight before the 
center of Alberto reaches land.  Weakening is expected once the 
center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico 
Thursday or Thursday night.
 
Alberto is a large tropical storm, with tropical-storm-force winds
extending outward up to 415 miles (665 km) north of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Alberto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Alberto is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas.
Maximum totals around 20 inches are possible across the higher
terrain of the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and
Tamaulipas. This rainfall will likely produce considerable flash and
urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding. Mudslides
are also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast
Mexico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Alberto, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Sargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft
Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft
Sabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast of northeastern
Mexico in areas of onshore winds north of where the center makes
landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large
and destructive waves.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area through early Thursday.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible this afternoon through
tonight across parts of Deep South Texas and Southeast Texas.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Alberto will affect the coast of Texas
and northeastern Mexico through Friday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
