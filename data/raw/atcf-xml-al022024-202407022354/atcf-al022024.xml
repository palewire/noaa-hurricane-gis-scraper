DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 16.1 North, longitude 71.7 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 22 mph (35 km/h), and this general
motion should continue through Wednesday, followed by a turn more
toward the west Wednesday night or Thursday.  On the forecast track,
the center of Beryl will move rapidly across the central Caribbean
Sea tonight and is forecast to pass near or over Jamaica on
Wednesday.  The center is expected to pass near or over the Cayman
Islands Wednesday night or early Thursday and approach the Yucatan
Peninsula of Mexico Thursday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 150 mph (240 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Beryl is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is forecast during the next day or
two.  However, Beryl is forecast to be at or near major hurricane
intensity while it passes near Jamaica on Wednesday and the Cayman
Islands on Wednesday night. Additional weakening is expected
thereafter, though Beryl is forecast to remain a hurricane in the
northwestern Caribbean.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 943 mb (27.85 inches).
