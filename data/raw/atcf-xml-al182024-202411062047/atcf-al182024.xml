DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM EST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was located
near latitude 22.6 North, longitude 82.7 West. Rafael is moving
toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A general northwestward
motion is anticipated tonight.  A slower west-northwestward to 
westward motion is expected Friday through the weekend.  On the 
forecast track, Rafael is expected to cross Cuba this evening, and 
emerge over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico later this evening or 
tonight.  Rafael is forecast to move over the southern Gulf of 
Mexico this weekend. 

Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Rafael is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is expected 
before Rafael makes landfall in western Cuba.  Some weakening is 
forecast while Rafael crosses western Cuba, but the storm is 
forecast to remain a hurricane over the southeastern Gulf of 
Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km). A wind gust to 45 mph (72 km/h) was recently reported at 
the Havana International Airport. 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in portions of western 
Cuba through the evening.  Tropical storm conditions are expected 
in parts of west-central Cuba and the lower and middle Florida Keys 
through tonight.
 
RAINFALL: Heavy rainfall will impact areas of the western Caribbean
through early Thursday, particularly across the Cayman Islands and
western Cuba.  Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are expected across
portions of western Cuba, with isolated higher totals up to 12
inches in areas of higher terrain. This will lead to areas of flash 
flooding and mudslides. Across the Cayman Islands additional 
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected.
 
Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected for the Lower and
Middle Florida Keys.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Rafael, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels as much as 9 to
14 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the southern coast of Cuba in the Hurricane Warning area, including
the Isle of Youth.
 
The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally
dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving
inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the following
heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Lower Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
TORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes are possible through tonight over
the Florida Keys and far southwestern Florida mainland.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to affect much of the
western Caribbean during the next day or so and will also spread
across most of the Gulf of Mexico from east to west late this week
into the weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
