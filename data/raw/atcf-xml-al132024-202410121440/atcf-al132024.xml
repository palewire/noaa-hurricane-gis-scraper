DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the remnants of Leslie were located near
latitude 33.3 North, longitude 43.4 West. The remnants are moving
quickly toward the northeast near 31 mph (50 km/h). A gradual turn 
toward the east at a fast forward speed is expected starting 
tonight, with a continued eastward motion expected into early next 
week. The remnants of Leslie are expected to move over or very near 
the Azores Sunday and early Monday.
 
Recent satellite-derived wind data indicate that Leslie has 
degenerated into a trough, but maximum sustained winds remain near 
50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. The remnants of Leslie are 
expected to gradually weaken during the next couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
