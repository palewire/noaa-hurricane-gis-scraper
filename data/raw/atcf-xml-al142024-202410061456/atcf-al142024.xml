DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Milton was 
located near latitude 22.4 North, longitude 94.4 West. Milton is 
moving toward the east-southeast near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected today. An eastward to east-northeastward 
motion is forecast on Tuesday and during the next couple of days, 
followed by a faster northeastward motion on Wednesday.  On the 
forecast track, Milton is forecast to move north of the Yucatan 
Peninsula and to move across the Gulf of Mexico and approach the 
west coast of the Florida Peninsula by midweek.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Milton is forecast to rapidly intensify during 
the next couple of days and become a hurricane later today and a 
major hurricane late Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches)
based on NOAA dropsonde data.

of the southwestern Gulf of Mexico today.  These swells are expected
to spread northward and eastward along much of the Gulf Coast by

current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
