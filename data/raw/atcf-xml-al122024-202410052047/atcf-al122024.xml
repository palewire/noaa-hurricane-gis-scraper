DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located 
near latitude 29.6 North, longitude 50.0 West. Kirk is moving toward 
the north near 20 mph (31 km/h) and this motion is expected to 
continue through tonight. A faster northeastward motion is expected 
on Sunday and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Kirk is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Weakening is forecast through early next week,
but Kirk will remain a large hurricane for the next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 949 mb (28.03 inches).

Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles. These swells are expected to
spread westward to the east coast of the United States, Atlantic
Canada, and the Bahamas tonight and Sunday, and to the Azores
on Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
