WATCHES AND WARNINGS

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was located
near latitude 24.5 North, longitude 88.8 West. Rafael is moving
toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h). A slower west-northwestward 
motion is expected during the next day or so. After that, Rafael is 
likely to meander over the central Gulf of Mexico through early 
next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher
gusts. Steady weakening is expected during the next few days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 961 mb (28.38 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to spread across most
of the Gulf of Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
