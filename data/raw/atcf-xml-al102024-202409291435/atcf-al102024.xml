WATCHES AND WARNINGS

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaac was located 
near latitude 43.2 North, longitude 35.6 West. Isaac is moving 
toward the northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this motion is 
expected to continue during the next couple of days, followed by a 
turn toward the north-northeast on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts, and continued weakening is forecast over the next 
few days. Isaac is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone on 
Monday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles 
(335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 971 mb (28.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and an upstream deep-layer trough 
will affect the Azores over the next few days. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM GMT.
