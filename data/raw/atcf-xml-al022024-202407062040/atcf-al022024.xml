during the next 36 hours in the indicated locations. For a
depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.  Persons
located within these areas should take all necessary actions to
protect life and property from rising water and the potential for
other dangerous conditions.  Promptly follow evacuation and other
instructions from local officials.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was
located near latitude 23.9 North, longitude 93.0 West. Beryl is
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this motion 
should continue through Sunday.  A turn toward the north-northwest 
is expected Sunday night, with a turn toward the north on Monday.  
On the forecast track, the center of Beryl will approach the Texas 
coast on Sunday and Sunday night and then make landfall on the 
Texas coast on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is expected, and Beryl is forecast to become a 
hurricane again Sunday or Sunday night before it reaches the Texas 
coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the NHC website at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area by early Monday.  Winds are first expected to reach
tropical storm strength by late Sunday, making outdoor preparations
difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch areas
in Texas by early Monday, with tropical storm conditions beginning
by late Sunday or Sunday night.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm
warning areas in Texas and northeastern Mexico late by Sunday or
Sunday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mesquite Bay, TX to Sargent, TX...4-6 ft
Matagorda Bay...4-6 ft
Sargent, TX to San Luis Pass, TX...3-5 ft
N Entrance Padre Island NS, TX to Mesquite Bay, TX...3-5 ft
Corpus Christi Bay...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to N Entrance Padre Island NS, TX...2-4 
ft
San Luis Pass, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft
Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
Sabine Pass, TX to Cameron, LA...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches with localized amounts
of 15 inches is expected across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and
eastern Texas beginning late Sunday through midweek.  This rainfall
will likely produce areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which
may be locally considerable. Minor to isolated moderate river
flooding is also possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Beryl, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero

TORNADOES: A few tornadoes could occur along the Texas Coast Sunday 
afternoon and Sunday night.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Beryl are expected to affect eastern 
Mexico and much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. during the next few 
days.  These swells are expected to cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
