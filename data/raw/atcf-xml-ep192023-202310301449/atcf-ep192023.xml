A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Entire coast of El Salvador
* Pacific coast of Honduras including the Gulf of Fonseca
* Honduras/Nicaragua border southward to Puerto Sandino.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 11.1 North, longitude 91.2 West. Pilar is
moving toward the east-northeast near 6 mph (9 km/h), and a 
continued east-northeastward motion is expected during the next day 
or two. On the forecast track, Pilar could be near the coast of El
Salvador or Nicaragua Tuesday through early Wednesday, though the 
core of the system is expected to remain offshore.  The storm is 
forecast to move west-southwestward away from land on Thursday.
 
Satellite estimates indicate that maximum sustained winds have 
increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.  Further 
strengthening is expected during the next day or so, and Pilar could 
be near hurricane strength on Tuesday. Weakening is expected to 
begin on Wednesday and continue through Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, for portions of Central 
America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica through Wednesday. 
This rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding, along with 
mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days. 
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather 
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical
Storm Watch area early Tuesday.
