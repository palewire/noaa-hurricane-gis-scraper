WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the remnants of Nadine were located near
latitude 16.5 North, longitude 93.0 West. The remnants are moving
toward the west-southwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and they are
expected to move into the eastern Pacific later today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts.
 
The combination of the remnants of Nadine and influences from a
Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event are forecast to result in the
formation of a new low pressure system off the coast of southern
Mexico in a day or so. Additional development is expected after
that time, and a tropical depression is expected to form during the
early to middle part of this week while the system moves westward
at about 15 mph away from the coast of Mexico.

For additional information on the remnants of Nadine please see 
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under 
AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, on the web at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php, and the latest updates in the 
East Pacific Tropical Weather Outlook on the web at 
hurricanes.gov/gtwo.php?basin=epac.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
