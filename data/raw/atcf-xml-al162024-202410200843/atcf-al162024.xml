and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area. A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Oscar was located
near latitude 21.1 North, longitude 73.1 West.  Oscar is moving
toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A west-southwestward or 
westward motion at a slower forward speed is expected through 
tonight, followed by a turn toward the northwest and north on 
Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Oscar 
will move across Great Inagua this morning, make landfall along the 
northeastern coast of Cuba later this afternoon or evening, and 
then move across eastern Cuba tonight and Monday.  Oscar will then 
accelerate northeastward across the central Bahamas on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are estimated to be near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Oscar is forecast to reach the northeastern 
coast of Cuba as a hurricane later this afternoon.  Weakening is 
expected after landfall, but Oscar could still be a tropical storm 
when it moves north of Cuba late Monday and moves across the central 
Bahamas on Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 5 miles (10 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles
(75 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
