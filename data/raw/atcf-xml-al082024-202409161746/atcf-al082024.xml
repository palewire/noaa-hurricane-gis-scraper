For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude 
33.1 North, longitude 78.3 West. The system is moving toward the 
north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A northwestward motion is 
expected during the next day or two. On the forecast track, the low 
will reach the coast of South Carolina by this evening and then 
move inland across the Carolinas tonight through early Wednesday.
 
Surface observations indicate that maximum sustained winds have 
decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Continued 
weakening is expected during the next day or so, especially after 
the system moves inland. The low is forecast to dissipate over the 
Carolinas by early Wednesday.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km) 
from the center. A NOS station at Wrightsville Beach, North 
Carolina, recently reported a sustained wind of 35 mph (56 km/h) and 
a gust of 40 mph (65 km/h). A C-MAN station at Masonboro Inlet, 
North Carolina, recently reported a sustained wind of 32 mph (52 
km/h) and a gust of 40 mph (65 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight can be found in
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO
header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions within the warning area are 
expected to diminish through late this afternoon.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
South Santee River, SC to Oregon Inlet, NC... 1-3 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers, NC... 1-3 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers, NC... 1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves. Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances. For information specific to
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight will bring 4 to 8 inches
of rainfall, with isolated totals near 10 inches, across portions of
northeast South Carolina and southeast North Carolina into tonight.
Across the remainder of North Carolina, 2 to 4 inches of rainfall,
with isolated totals near 6 inches, is expected through Tuesday.
Over much of Virginia, 1 to 3 inches of rainfall, with locally
higher amounts, is expected tonight through Wednesday. This rainfall
could lead to a risk of flash and urban flooding and minor river
flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?ero.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes may occur through this evening across
eastern North Carolina.
 
SURF: Swells are forecast to affect portions of the coast of the
southeastern United States through Tuesday. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
