DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 21.8 North, longitude 90.8 West. Milton is moving
toward the east near 10 mph (17 km/h). This general motion is 
expected through tonight followed by a turn toward the east- 
northeast and northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday. On the forecast 
track, the center of Milton is forecast to move near or just north 
of the Yucatan Peninsula tonight and Tuesday, then cross the 
eastern Gulf of Mexico and approach the west coast of the Florida 
Peninsula on Wednesday.
 
Satellite data indicate that the maximum sustained winds have 
increased to near 180 mph (285 km/h) with higher gusts.  Milton is a 
potentially catastrophic category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  While fluctuations in intensity are 
expected, Milton is forecast to remain an extremely dangerous 
hurricane through landfall in Florida.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 905 mb (26.73 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone 
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC 
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 4
to 6 feet above ground level along the northern coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in areas of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Anclote River, FL to Englewood, FL...10-15 ft
Tampa Bay...10-15 ft
Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...6-10 ft
Charlotte Harbor...6-10 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Anclote River, FL...5-10 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...4-7 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
Sebastian Inlet, FL to Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL...2-4 ft
Altamaha Sound, GA to Edisto Beach, SC...2-4 ft
Dry Tortugas...2-4 ft
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches, with localized totals 
up to 15 inches, are expected across portions of the Florida 
Peninsula through Thursday. This rainfall brings the risk of 
considerable flash, urban, and areal flooding, along with the 
potential for moderate to major river flooding.

Milton will also produce rainfall totals 4 to 7 inches across the 
Florida Keys through Thursday. In addition, rainfall amounts of 
2 to 4 inches with isolated totals around 6 inches are expected 
across northern portions of the Yucatan Peninsula.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero. 
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area in
Mexico within a few hours, with tropical storm conditions expected 
to begin soon.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the watch 
areas in Mexico beginning tonight and Tuesday, and tropical storm 
conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning area beginning 
tonight. 

Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area on the 
west coast of Florida as early as Wednesday afternoon, with 
tropical storm conditions beginning early Wednesday.  Hurricane 
conditions could begin along the east coast of Florida in the watch 
areas on Wednesday night, with tropical storm conditions possible 
beginning Wednesday afternoon.  Tropical storm conditions 
are expected in the tropical storm warning areas in Florida 
beginning early Wednesday and will spread northward through the day.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to 
affect much of the Gulf Coast within the next day or two, and are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.
