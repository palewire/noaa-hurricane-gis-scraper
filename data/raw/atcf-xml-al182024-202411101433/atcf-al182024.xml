DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rafael was
located near latitude 26.3 North, longitude 91.9 West. Rafael is
moving toward the north-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h). The storm
is expected to meander over the central Gulf of Mexico through
tonight, then turn toward the south and south-southwest on Monday
and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is expected, and Rafael is forecast to degenerate to a
post-tropical remnant low by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center. A few hours ago, NOAA buoy 42001 over the central
Gulf of Mexico recorded a sustained wind of 38 mph (61 km/h) with a
gust of 45 mph (72 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Rafael can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael will continue impacting portions of
the northern and western Gulf Coast through the remainder of this
weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
