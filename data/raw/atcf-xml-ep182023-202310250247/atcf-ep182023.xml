DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Otis was located
near latitude 16.1 North, longitude 99.7 West. Otis is moving toward
the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion
is expected through for the next day or so, with landfall
forecast overnight or early on Wednesday in southern Mexico.
 
Satellite data indicate that the maximum sustained winds have
increased to near 160 mph (260 km/h) with higher gusts.  Otis is a 
category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  
Otis is forecast to remain a category 5 hurricane through landfall, 
and rapid weakening is then forecast due to the higher terrain of 
Mexico. Otis will likely dissipate over southern Mexico on 
Wednesday night.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 927 mb (27.38 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Otis can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within portions of the
hurricane warning area by late tonight and early Wednesday, with 
extremely destructive winds near the core.  Tropical storm 
conditions are expected to first reach the coast within the warning 
areas soon, and then spread northwestward within the warning areas 
through Wednesday.  Winds affecting the upper floors of high-rise 
buildings will be significantly stronger than those near ground 
level.

STORM SURGE:  A potentially catastrophic storm surge is expected to
produce life-threatening coastal flooding near and to the east of
where the center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Otis is expected to produce rainfall totals of 8 to 16
inches with maximum amounts of 20 inches through Thursday across
Guerrero and the western coastal sections of Oaxaca.  This rainfall
will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas
of higher terrain.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Otis will affect portions of the southern
coast of Mexico during the next couple of days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
