SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

* Bermuda
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 26.6 North, longitude 68.4 West. Ernesto is
moving toward the north near 13 mph (20 km/h).  This general motion
is expected to continue through early Friday, followed by a slower 
northeastward or north-northeastward motion late Friday and 
Saturday. A faster northeastward motion is expected later in 
the weekend.  On the forecast track, the center of Ernesto is 
expected to pass near or over Bermuda on Saturday.  
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast during the 
next day or so, and Ernesto could be near major hurricane strength 
on Friday.  Ernesto is forecast to be a large hurricane near Bermuda 
on Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 265
miles (425 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the Air 
Force Hurricane Hunters is 970 mb (28.64 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected on Bermuda Saturday, with
tropical storm conditions likely beginning Friday afternoon.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding on Bermuda in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Ernesto is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
6 to 12 inches on Bermuda with isolated maximum amounts up to 15
inches.  This rainfall may result in considerable life-threatening
flash flooding.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the 
Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and are beginning to reach 
Bermuda.  Swells are expected to reach the east coast of the United 
States overnight and continue into the weekend. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. 
Please consult products from your local weather office, and stay out 
of the water if advised by lifeguards.
