HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone One can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone One is expected to produce 
rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South 
Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible. This rainfall will 
likely produce flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed 
river flooding. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher 
terrain across northeast Mexico.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone One, please see the 
National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Sargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft
Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft
Sabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation, 
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic, 
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
In Mexico, minor coastal flooding is possible north of where the
center of the system crosses the coast in areas of onshore
winds.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area by tonight or Wednesday.

TORNADOES:  A couple of tornadoes may occur across parts of Deep 
South Texas on Wednesday.

SURF:  Swells generated by the disturbance will affect the coast of 
Texas and northeastern Mexico through Wednesday night.  These swells 
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
