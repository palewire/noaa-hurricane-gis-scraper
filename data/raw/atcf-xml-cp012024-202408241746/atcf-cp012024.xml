At 800 AM HST (1800 UTC), US Air Force weather reconnaisance 
aircraft determined the center of Tropical Storm Hone was
located near latitude 17.6 North, longitude 152.6 West. Hone is

expected to continue over the next several days with a gradual
decrease in forward speed. On this track, the center of Hone is
expected to pass near or south of the Big Island tonight into early
Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and
Hone is expected to be a hurricane Sunday through Monday southwest
of the Big Island of Hawaii.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
