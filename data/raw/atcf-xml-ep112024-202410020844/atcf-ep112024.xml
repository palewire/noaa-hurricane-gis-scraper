DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
Satellite-derived wind data indicate that the depression is located
farther west than previously estimated.  At 300 AM CST (0900 UTC),
the center of Tropical Depression Eleven-E was located near latitude
15.4 North, longitude 95.8 West.  The depression is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this general motion is
expected to continue for the next day or so.  On the forecast
track, the center of the depression will be near the coast of
Mexico in the Tropical Storm Warning area late tonight or early 
Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is possible before the center reaches the
coast, and the system could become a tropical storm later today.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
