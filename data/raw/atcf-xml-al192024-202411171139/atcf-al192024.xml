DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Sara was
located near latitude 16.7 North, longitude 87.9 West. Sara is
moving toward the west-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this
general motion with some increase in forward speed is expected
through tonight. On the forecast track, the center of Sara will make
landfall in Belize later this morning or around midday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Only small fluctuations in strength are anticipated until landfall. 
Weakening is forecast after the storm moves inland, and dissipation 
is expected over the southern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula 
tonight or on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).

RAINFALL: Through early next week, rainfall amounts of 15 to 25
inches with isolated storm totals around 40 inches area expected
over northern Honduras. This rainfall will lead to widespread areas
of life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding and
mudslides, especially along and near the Sierra La Esperanza.
 
Elsewhere across the rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern
Guatemala, western Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo,
Tropical Storm Sara is expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain
with localized totals around 15 inches through early next week. This
will result in areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along
with the potential of mudslides.

above ground level near and to the north of where the center of Sara 
crosses the coast of Belize. Near the coast, the surge will be 
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
