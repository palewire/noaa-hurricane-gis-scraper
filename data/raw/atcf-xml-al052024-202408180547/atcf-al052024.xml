A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are

Interests in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the progress
of Ernesto.  A watch may be required for a portion of this area 
later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was
located near latitude 34.2 North, longitude 63.1 West.  Ernesto is
moving toward the north-northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h), and some 
increase in forward speed is forecast to begin later today, followed 
by a turn toward the northeast and east-northeast on Monday and 
Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Ernesto will continue 
moving away from Bermuda today and pass near southeastern 
Newfoundland late Monday and Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Some re-intensification is possible later today or tonight, 
and Ernesto could regain hurricane status.  The cyclone will likely 
become post-tropical near southeastern Newfoundland by Monday night 
or Tuesday morning.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 978 mb (28.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue on Bermuda
for the next few hours.
 
STORM SURGE:  Coastal flooding is still possible on Bermuda in areas
of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Ernesto is expected to produce an additional 1 to 2 inches
or 25 to 50 mm of rainfall across Bermuda, with storm total amounts 
of 7 to 9 inches (175 to 225 mm). This rainfall will likely result 
in considerable life-threatening flash flooding to the island.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the
Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic
Canada today.  Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are
likely in these areas during the next couple of days.  Please
consult products from your local weather office, and stay out of the
water if advised by lifeguards.
