DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Helene was
located near latitude 20.7 North, longitude 86.2 West. Helene is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  This motion
should continue through this morning, followed by a general
northward motion beginning later today and continuing through
Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Helene will pass near
the northeastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula this morning, move
across the eastern Gulf of Mexico on later today and Thursday, and
reach the Big Bend coast of Florida late Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast, and Helene is expected to become 
a hurricane later today.  The storm is forecast to rapidly 
strengthen over the eastern Gulf of Mexico and become a major 
hurricane on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center. A Mexican Navy weather station at Isla Contoy 
recently reported sustained winds of 38 mph (61 km/h) and a wind 
gust of 48 mph (78 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure recently reported by an Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 985 mb (29.09 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Helene is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches over western Cuba, the Cayman Islands
and the northeast Yucatan Peninsula, with isolated totals around 12
inches. This rainfall brings a risk of considerable flooding.
 
Over the Southeastern U.S., Helene is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 5 to 10 inches with isolated totals around 15
inches. This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable
flash and urban flooding, with areas of significant river flooding.
Landslides are possible in areas of steep terrain in the southern
Appalachians.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Ochlockonee River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...10-15 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-10 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...5-10 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...5-8 ft
Tampa Bay...5-8 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...4-7 ft
Englewood, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Charlotte Harbor...3-5 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the southern
coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba, including the Isle of Youth.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
ground level in areas of onshore winds within the warning area along
the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning 
area in Mexico during the next several hours, with tropical storm 
conditions already ongoing. Hurricane conditions are expected within 
the U.S. hurricane warning area late Thursday. Hurricane conditions 
are possible for the western portion of Cuba later today. Tropical 
storm conditions are expected to begin in the warning area in Cuba 
during the next several hours. Tropical storm conditions are 
expected in southern Florida later today and spreading northward 
through Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the 
tropical storm watch area beginning Thursday and Thursday night.
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two may occur tonight over parts of
the western Florida peninsula and southern Alabama.  The risk of
tornadoes will increase on Thursday, expanding across Florida and
into parts of Georgia and South Carolina.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect the southern coast of 
Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico during the next couple of 
days.  Swells will spread northward toward the west coast of Florida 
and the northeastern Gulf Coast later today and Thursday. These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
