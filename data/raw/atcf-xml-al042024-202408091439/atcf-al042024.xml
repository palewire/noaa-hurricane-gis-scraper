HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce an additional 1 to 3 inches
of rainfall with locally higher amounts, across portions of the
coastal Carolinas today, with locally considerable flooding
expected.
 
From portions of northern Virginia through Upstate New York, 2 to 4
inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 6 inches, are expected
through late tonight. This will likely result in areas of
considerable flash and urban flooding, as well as river flooding.
 
For portions of Northern New England, 1 to 3 inches of rain with
locally higher amounts are expected through Friday night. This will
result in isolated to scattered instances of flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with  Debby, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: The threat for tornadoes will shift into eastern
Maryland, New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania and eastern New York
today.
 
WIND: Wind gusts of 30-50 MPH will be possible into tonight
across portions of eastern Maryland, Delaware, southeast
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, far southeast New York into Long Island,
coastal Connecticut, and far northeast New York into Vermont. Given
saturated ground conditions these winds may bring down trees and
result in isolated to scattered power outages.
 
SURF:  Large swells will continue to affect the Southeast,
Mid-Atlantic and Southern New England coast. These conditions are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
