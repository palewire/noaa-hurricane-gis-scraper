DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ileana was
located near latitude 19.9 North, longitude 108.0 West. Ileana is
moving toward the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this
motion is expected to continue through Friday. A turn to the north 
at a slightly slower forward speed is expected Friday night. On the 
forecast track, the center of Ileana should pass near or over the 
southern portion of Baja California Sur Friday and Friday night 
before emerging over the southern Gulf of California late Friday 
night or early Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is expected during the next 24 hours until 
Ileana reaches Baja California Sur. After that, some weakening is 
possible while the cyclone is near or over land.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ileana can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ileana is expected to produce 4-6 inches 
with localized higher amounts up to 8 inches across the coastal 
areas of Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco through early Friday. From 
Friday through Sunday, Tropical Storm Ileana may result in 4-6 
inches, with localized higher amounts up to 8 inches, across 
southern Baja California. For northwest coastal Sinaloa, Tropical 
Storm Ileana may produce between 6-8 inches with localized higher 
amounts up to 12 inches. This heavy rainfall will bring a risk of 
flash flooding and mudslides to portions of the area.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach
the coast of the southern Baja California Peninsula within the
warning area Friday morning, making outside preparations difficult
or dangerous. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the
watch area by early Saturday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Ileana will affect
portions of the coast of west-central Mexico during the next day or
so, and will spread northward along the coasts of the southern Baja
California Peninsula and mainland Mexico beginning tonight. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
