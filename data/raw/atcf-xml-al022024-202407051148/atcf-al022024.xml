DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 20.4 North, longitude 87.6 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h). A west-
northwestward motion is expected during the next day or so, with the
center expected to cross the northern Yucatan Peninsula today. Beryl 
is expected to emerge over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico tonight 
and then move northwestward toward northeastern Mexico and southern 
Texas by the end of the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 100 mph (160 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rapid weakening is expected as Beryl moves 
farther inland and crosses the Yucatan Peninsula today, but slow 
re-intensification is expected once Beryl moves back over the Gulf 
of Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105
miles (165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC, 
and on the NHC website at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are occurring in the hurricane warning
area on the Yucatan Peninsula and will continue this morning.  
Tropical storm conditions are occurring elsewhere in the hurricane 
warning area.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area along
the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula this morning.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area of the Yucatan Caribbean coast this morning and over the
Yucatan Gulf coast later today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch
area along portions of the coast of Belize this morning.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to
6 feet above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the east
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula within the hurricane warning area
and by as much as 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the west
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula in the tropical storm warning
area. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and 
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Through today Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals
of 4 to 6 inches, with localized amounts of 10 inches, across the
Yucatan Peninsula, with scattered instances of flash flooding
anticipated.
 
Heavy rainfall of 4 to 8 inches with locally higher amounts is
expected across portions of northeastern Mexico and South Texas by
Sunday into the coming week.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are currently impacting
portions of the coast of Cuba, the Cayman Islands, and the
Yucatan Peninsula.  The swells are expected to reach eastern Mexico
and much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. by late today. These swells
are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
