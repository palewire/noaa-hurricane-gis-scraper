RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts up to an inch are possible 
along the northeastern coast of Florida through this evening. In the 
wake of heavy rainfall from Milton, the risk of considerable urban 
flooding will linger through this evening across east central 
Florida. Moderate to major river flooding is ongoing and forecast 
throughout central Florida.

Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall

WIND: Gusty winds will likely continue along portions of the
southeastern U.S. coast through tonight.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to
affect portions of the southeast U.S. and the Bahamas during the
next couple of days.  These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
