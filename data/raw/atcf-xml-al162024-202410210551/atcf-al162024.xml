DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Oscar was
located inland over eastern Cuba near latitude 20.2 North, longitude
74.9 West. Oscar is moving toward the west-southwest near 5 mph (8
km/h). A turn to the west and northwest is expected today, followed 
by a faster northeastward motion on Tuesday and Wednesday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Oscar is expected to continue moving 
across eastern Cuba through this afternoon, then emerge off the
northern coast of Cuba late today or tonight and move near the 
southeastern and central Bahamas on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is expected as Oscar
interacts with the mountainous terrain of eastern Cuba, but Oscar
could still be a tropical storm when it moves north of Cuba late
today and then moves near the southeastern and central Bahamas on
Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.41 inches).
