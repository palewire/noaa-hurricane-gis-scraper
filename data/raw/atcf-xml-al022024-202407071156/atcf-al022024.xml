DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was
located by an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 25.5 
North, longitude 94.9 West. Beryl is moving toward the northwest 
near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this motion should continue through 
today.  A turn toward the north-northwest is expected tonight, with 
a turn toward the north on Monday. On the forecast track, the 
center of Beryl is expected to make landfall on the Texas coast 
Monday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Strengthening is expected, and Beryl is forecast to become a
hurricane again later today or tonight before it reaches the Texas
coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.29 inches) 
based on Air Force dropsonde data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the NHC website at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area by early Monday.  Winds are first expected to reach tropical
storm strength by late today, making outdoor preparations difficult
or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch areas by
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions beginning by tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm
warning areas in Texas and northeastern Mexico by tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area in Texas by tonight.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mesquite Bay, TX to San Luis Pass, TX...4-6 ft
Matagorda Bay...4-6 ft
San Luis Pass, TX to High Island, TX...3-5 ft
N Entrance Padre Island NS, TX to Mesquite Bay, TX...3-5 ft
Corpus Christi Bay...3-5 ft
Galveston Bay...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to N Entrance Padre Island NS, TX...2-4
ft
High Island, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft
Sabine Pass, TX to Cameron, LA...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches with localized amounts
of 15 inches is expected across portions of the middle and upper
Texas Gulf Coast and eastern Texas beginning today through Monday
night. This rainfall will produce areas of flash and urban flooding,
some of which may be locally considerable. Minor to isolated
moderate river flooding is also expected.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Beryl, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero
 
TORNADOES: A tornado threat will likely develop this evening into
tonight for portions of the middle and upper Texas coast.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Beryl are expected to affect eastern
Mexico and much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. during the next few
days.  These swells are expected to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
