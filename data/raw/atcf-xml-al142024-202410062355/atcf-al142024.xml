Interests in the remainder of the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, the
Florida Peninsula, the Florida Keys, and the northwestern Bahamas
should monitor the progress of this system.
 
Storm Surge and Hurricane Watches will likely be issued for portions 
of Florida early Monday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was 
located by Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunters near latitude 22.5 
North, longitude 93.4 West.  Milton is moving toward the east near 
7 mph (11 km/h), and this general motion is expected tonight.  An 
eastward to east-northeastward motion is forecast on Monday, 
followed by a faster northeastward motion on  Tuesday and 
Wednesday.  On the forecast track, Milton is forecast to move just 
north of the Yucatan Peninsula and across the southern Gulf of 
Mexico Monday and Tuesday and approach the west coast of the 
Florida Peninsula by Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Milton is forecast to intensify rapidly during the next 
couple of days and become a major hurricane on Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80
miles (130 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 981 mb (28.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Hurricane Milton can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 2
to 4 feet above ground level along the northern coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in areas of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches, with localized totals
up to 15 inches, are expected across portions of the Florida
Peninsula and the Keys through Wednesday night. This rainfall brings
the risk of considerable flash, urban, and areal flooding, along
with the potential for moderate to major river flooding.
 
Milton will also produce rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches across
portions of the northern Yucatan Peninsula.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin as early as
Monday morning in the warning area, and hurricane conditions are
possible beginning Monday afternoon.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the system are affecting the coast of the
southwestern Gulf of Mexico.  These swells are expected to spread 
northward and eastward along much of the Gulf Coast within the next 
day or two, and are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
