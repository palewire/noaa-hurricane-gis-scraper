DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located 
near latitude 11.2 North, longitude 57.3 West. Beryl is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h). A continued quick 
westward to west-northwestward motion is expected during the next 
few days. On the forecast track, the center of Beryl is expected to 
move across the Windward Islands Monday morning and across the 
southeastern and central Caribbean Sea late Monday through 
Wednesday.
 
Data from both the Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft indicate that maximum sustained winds remain near 130 mph 
(215 km/h) with higher gusts.  Beryl is a category 4 hurricane on 
the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Fluctuations in strength 
are likely during the next day or so, and Beryl is expected to 
remain an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane through landfall 
in the Windward Islands.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on Hurricane Hunter aircraft data 
is 958 mb (28.29 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area beginning early Monday morning.  Potentially catastrophic wind
damage is expected where the eyewall or core of Beryl moves through 
portions of the Windward Islands, with the highest risk of the core 
in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada.
 
Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains
are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be
even greater.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area starting late tonight, making outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area 
starting late tonight for Dominica, and by Tuesday afternoon for 
parts of the southern coast of Hispaniola.
 
STORM SURGE:  A life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels
by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of
onshore winds near where the eye makes landfall in the hurricane
warning area.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of
3 to 6 inches across Barbados and the Windward Islands through
Monday. Localized maxima of 10 inches is possible, especially in the
Grenadines. This rainfall may cause flash flooding in vulnerable
areas.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are expected across
Windward and southern Leeward Islands during the next couple of
days.  Swells are also expected to reach the southern coasts
of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola in the next day or so. These swells
are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
