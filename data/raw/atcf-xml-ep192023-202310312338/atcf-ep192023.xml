DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was 
located near latitude 11.7 North, longitude 89.4 West. Pilar is 
moving toward the northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h). Pilar is forecast 
to move little tonight into tomorrow. On the forecast track, Pilar 
could move a little closer to the coast of El Salvador or Nicaragua 
through early Wednesday, though the core of the system is expected 
to remain offshore. The storm is forecast to begin moving 
west-southwestward away from land by Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some slight strengthening is possible over the next day or so before 
gradual weakening likely begins on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5
to 10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, over portions of
Central America from southern El Salvador, across southern Honduras,
western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica through Wednesday.  This
rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides
in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the Tropical
Storm Watch area during the next day or so.
