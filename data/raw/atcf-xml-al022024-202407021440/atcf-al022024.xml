dangerous.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northwestern Caribbean, including the
Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, should closely monitor the progress of
Beryl. Additional watches or warnings will be required later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located 
near latitude 15.3 North, longitude 68.9 West. Beryl is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 22 mph (35 km/h), and this general 
motion should continue through Wednesday, followed by a turn more 
toward the west on Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Beryl will move quickly across the central Caribbean Sea today and 
is forecast to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday and the Cayman Islands 
on Thursday.  The center is forecast to approach the Yucatan 
Peninsula of Mexico on Thursday night.
 
Reports from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 160 mph (260 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Beryl is a category 5 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is forecast later 
today, but Beryl is still expected to be near major hurricane 
intensity as it moves into the central Caribbean and passes near 
Jamaica on Wednesday and the Cayman Islands on Thursday. Additional 
weakening is expected thereafter, though Beryl is forecast to remain 
a hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft data is 938 mb (27.70 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast of
Jamaica within the warning area on Wednesday.  Winds are expected to
first reach tropical storm strength early on Wednesday, making
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along the
south coast of Hispaniola later today.
 
Hurricane conditions could begin on Thursday across the Cayman
Islands.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 5
to 8 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the immediate coast of Jamaica.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet
above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the
immediate coast of the Cayman Islands.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
ground level in areas of onshore winds along the southern coast of
Hispaniola.
 
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Hurricane Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 
4 to 8 inches, with localized maxima of 12 inches, across Jamaica 
and the southwestern Haitian Peninsula through late Wednesday. Beryl 
will also produce rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches with isolated 
amounts of 10 inches across the Barahona Peninsula in southwest 
Dominican Republic. Isolated totals of 6 inches or more are also 
anticipated across the mountainous terrain in the central Dominican 
Republic. This rainfall is likely to cause flash flooding and 
mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl will continue across the 
Windward and southern Leeward Islands during the next day or so. 
Swells are expected to reach the southern coasts of Puerto Rico and 
Hispaniola later today. These swells are expected to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
