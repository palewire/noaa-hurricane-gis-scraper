Interests elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Nicaragua and in
southern Guatemala should monitor the progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was 
located near latitude 11.9 North, longitude 89.4 West. Pilar is 
drifting toward the north near 2 mph (4 km/h). Beginning tomorrow 
into Thursday, Pilar is forecast to start moving westward to 
west-southwestward. On the forecast track, the storm may remain in 
close proximity to coastal Central America into tomorrow, but 
Pilar's core is forecast to remain offshore.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts. Little change in strength is anticipated over
the next day or so, followed by gradual weakening.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5
to 10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, for portions of
Central America from southern El Salvador, across southern
Honduras, western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica through
Wednesday. This rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding,
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the Tropical
Storm Watch area during the next day or so.
