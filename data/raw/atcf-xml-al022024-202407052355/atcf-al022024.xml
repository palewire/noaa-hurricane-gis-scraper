WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* The Texas coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande northward
to Sargent
* The northeastern coast from mainland Mexico from Barra el
Mezquital to the mouth of the Rio Grande
 
A Storm Surge Watch is in effect for...
* The Texas coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande northward
to Sargent
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico west of Cabo
Catoche to Campeche
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests elsewhere in northeastern Mexico and the Texas coast
should closely monitor the progress of Beryl. Additional watches
and warnings will likely be issued for portions of this area
tonight and Saturday.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was
located near latitude 21.3 North, longitude 89.7 West. Beryl is
moving toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue through early Saturday.  A turn 
to the northwest is expected later on Saturday, with the center of 
Beryl expected to approach the coast of northeastern Mexico and 
Texas Sunday and Sunday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Gradual strengthening is expected, and Beryl is forecast to 
regain hurricane status on Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the NHC website at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of
the northern Yucatan Peninsula and should spread westward along the
Gulf coast of the peninsula for the next few hours.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area along
the Gulf coast of northeastern Mexico and Texas by late Sunday, and 
tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area on Sunday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause 
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters 
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the 
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if 
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Baffin Bay, TX to Sargent, TX...3-5 ft
Corpus Christi Bay...3-5 ft
Matagorda Bay...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Baffin Bay, TX...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?peakSurge.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet
above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the west and
north coasts of the Yucatan Peninsula in the tropical storm
warning area. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 6 
inches, with localized amounts of 10 inches, across the Yucatan 
Peninsula, with scattered instances of flash flooding
anticipated.
 
Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches with localized amounts of 15 inches
is expected across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and eastern
Texas beginning late Sunday through the middle of next week.  This
rainfall is expected to produce areas of flash and urban flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Beryl, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are currently impacting
portions of the coast the Yucatan Peninsula. The swells are 
expected to reach eastern Mexico and much of the Gulf Coast of the 
U.S. by early Saturday. These swells are expected to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
