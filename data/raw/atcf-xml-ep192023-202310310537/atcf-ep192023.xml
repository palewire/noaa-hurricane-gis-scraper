DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was 
located by satellite imagery near latitude 11.2 North, longitude 
90.6 West.  Pilar is moving toward the east near 5 mph (7 km/h), and 
an east-northeast motion is expected to resume later today through 
early Wednesday. On the forecast track, Pilar could be near the 
coast of El Salvador or Nicaragua late today through early 
Wednesday, though the core of the system is expected to remain 
offshore.  The storm is forecast to begin moving west-southwestward 
away from land by late Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some strengthening is forecast, and Pilar could be near
hurricane strength by late today.  Weakening is expected to begin
by late Wednesday and continue through Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, over portions of
Central America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica through
Wednesday.  This rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding,
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical Storm 
Watch areas this morning.
