DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the disturbance was centered near
latitude 22.5 North, longitude 93.0 West. The system is moving
toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A turn toward the west 
with an increase in forward speed is expected overnight and on 
Wednesday, and the system is forecast to reach the coast of 
northeastern Mexico by Wednesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some increase in strength is possible during the next 36
hours, and the disturbance is forecast to become a tropical storm on
Wednesday.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.
 
The disturbance is quite large, and tropical-storm-force winds
extend outward up to 415 miles (665 km) to the north of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches) 
based on Air Force Reserve dropsonde data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone One can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone One is expected to produce
rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South
Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible. This rainfall will
likely produce flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed
river flooding. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher
terrain across northeast Mexico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone One, please see the
National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Sargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft
Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft
Sabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
In Mexico, minor coastal flooding is possible north of where the
center of the system crosses the coast in areas of onshore
winds.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area overnight or Wednesday.
 
TORNADOES:  A couple of tornadoes are possible Wednesday across 
parts of Deep South Texas into Southeast Texas.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the disturbance will affect the coast of
Texas and northeastern Mexico through early Thursday.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
