DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Kirk was located near 
latitude 21.1 North, longitude 46.7 West. Kirk is moving toward the 
northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general motion is expected 
to continue through early Friday. A turn toward the north and 
north-northeast at a faster forward speed is forecast over the 
weekend.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 130 mph (215 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Kirk is a category 4 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some additional strengthening 
is forecast the next day or so.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 945 mb (27.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are spreading westward and are
expected to reach portions of the Leeward Islands on Friday,
Bermuda and the Greater Antilles on Saturday, and the east coast
of the United States and the Bahamas on Sunday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
