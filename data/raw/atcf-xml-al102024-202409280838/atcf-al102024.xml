SUMMARY OF 900 AM GMT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION

ABOUT 785 MI...1265 KM W OF THE AZORES

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaac was located
near latitude 39.3 North, longitude 41.3 West. Isaac is moving
toward the northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this general motion 
should continue through Monday followed by a turn toward the 
north-northeast on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is expected through 
mid-day, followed by gradual weakening through the remainder of 
the forecast period.  Isaac is expected to be a post-tropical 
cyclone on Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough could spread into the Azores through the weekend. 
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather 
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM GMT.
