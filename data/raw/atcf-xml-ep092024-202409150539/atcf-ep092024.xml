DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM MST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ileana was
located near latitude 25.4 North, longitude 109.2 West.  Ileana is
meandering off the coast of northern Sinaloa but has a longer-term 
motion toward the west-northwest near 2 mph (4 km/h).  A turn 
toward the northwest is expected soon with an increase in forward 
speed.  On the forecast track, the center of Ileana will move near 
the coastal region of northern Sinaloa overnight, and then move over 
the Gulf of California roughly parallel to the coast on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have begun decreasing and are now near 40 
mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, 
and Ileana is expected to degenerate into a remnant low on Sunday.  
The remnant low is expected to dissipate by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).

southern Sonora during the next few hours.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ileana will affect portions of the
Gulf of California coasts of Sinaloa, southern Sonora, and southern
Baja California Sur during the next day or so.  These swells could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
