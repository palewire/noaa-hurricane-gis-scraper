Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength of the post-tropical low is forecast 
during the next 48 hours. 
 
Gale-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km) from the 
center of the post-tropical low.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
