DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Carlotta was
located near latitude 18.6 North, longitude 115.2 West. Carlotta is
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and a 
continued west-northwestward motion with a gradual slowdown is 
anticipated over the next several days. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have increase to near 80 mph (130 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast during the next 
day or so, followed by some weakening by early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km). Earlier, a Mexican Navy automated station on Isla Clarion 
reported a sustained wind of 55 mph (86 km/h) and a gust of 81 mph 
(130 km/h). 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).  
Earlier, a Mexican Navy automated station on Isla Clarion reported a 
minimum pressure of 986 mb (29.11 inches). 
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Carlotta are affecting the coasts of
west-central mainland Mexico and the southern Baja California
peninsula. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions through Sunday. Please consult products
from your local weather office.
