DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located 
near latitude 13.4 North, longitude 64.0 West. Beryl is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 21 mph (33 km/h). The center of Beryl 
will move quickly away from the southern Windward Islands tonight 
and continue westward to west-northwestward during the next few 
days. On the forecast track, the center of Beryl will move across 
the southeastern and central Caribbean Sea tonight through Tuesday 
and is forecast to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday.
 
NOAA Hurricane Hunters indicate that maximum sustained winds have 
increased to near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher gusts. Beryl is a 
strong category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind 
Scale. Fluctuations in strength are likely during the next day or 
so, but Beryl is expected to remain an extremely dangerous major 
hurricane as its moves over the eastern Caribbean. Some weakening is 
expected in the central Caribbean by midweek, though Beryl is 
forecast to remain a hurricane.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125
miles (205 km).
 
The minimum central pressure recently measured by the NOAA Hurricane 
Hunter dropsonde data is 938 mb (27.70 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast on 
Jamaica within the warning area on Wednesday afternoon.  Winds are 
expected to first reach tropical storm strength earlier on 
Wednesday, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous. 
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along the 
south coast of Hispaniola by late Tuesday.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 
to 4 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along 
the immediate coast of Jamaica.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
ground level in areas of onshore winds along the southern coast of
Hispaniola.
 
RAINFALL:  Hurricane Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of
3 to 6 inches across the Windward Islands through this evening.
Localized maxima of 10 inches are possible, especially in the
Grenadines and Grenada. This rainfall may cause flash flooding in
vulnerable areas.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl will continue across the
Windward and southern Leeward Islands during the next couple of
days. Swells are also expected to reach the southern coasts of
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola late tonight into Tuesday. These swells
are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
