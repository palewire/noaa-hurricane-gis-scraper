Island around midweek.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple 
of days, and Hone is expected to become a tropical storm by 
tomorrow. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).
