DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was 
located near latitude 30.2 North, longitude 90.3 West. Francine is 
moving toward the northeast near 14 mph (22 km/h). A slower 
north-northeastward to northward motion is expected during the next 
couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Continued rapid weakening is forecast, and Francine is expected to 
become a tropical depression later today and a post-tropical cyclone 
by tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km) 
from the center. The New Orleans Lakefront Airport recently reported 
sustained winds of 37 mph (60 km/h) and a gust of 47 mph (76 km/h). 
The Bay Waveland Yacht Club in Mississippi recently reported 
sustained winds of 38 mph (61 km/h) and a gust of 46 mph (74 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations 
is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Francine can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue in 
portions of the warning area through early this morning.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to 
8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across southeastern 
Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama, and the Florida 
Panhandle through tonight. This rainfall could lead to considerable 
flash, urban, and river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS1 with the WMO header ACUS41
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mouth of the Pearl River, LA to Ocean Springs, MS...4-6 ft
Lake Pontchartrain...4-6 ft
Ocean Springs, MS to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft
Morgan City, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...3-5 ft
Lake Maurepas...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible during the next few hours 
across parts of southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern 
Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle. The tornado risk will move into 
additional parts of Alabama, southwest Georgia, and the Florida 
Panhandle today.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting much of the
northern Gulf Coast, likely causing life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
