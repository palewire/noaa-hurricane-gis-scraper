DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located inland over southeastern Georgia near latitude 31.6 North, 
longitude 81.6 West. Debby is moving toward the northeast near 7 mph 
(11 km/h).  A slower motion toward the east and then north is 
expected through Thursday night.  On the forecast track, the center 
of Debby is expected to move offshore the coast of Georgia later 
today, drift offshore through early Thursday, and then move inland 
over South Carolina on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday while 
Debby drifts offshore.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
to the east of the center.  A weather station on Folly Beach, South 
Carolina, recently reported a sustained wind of 41 mph (67 km/h) 
and a gust to 53 mph (85 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
tropical storm warning area along the northeastern Florida and
Georgia coasts through this morning.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected to continue along the coast of South Carolina within the
tropical storm warning area through Thursday night.  Tropical
storm conditions are possible within the tropical storm watch area
in North Carolina beginning Wednesday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Altamaha Sound, GA to Cape Fear, NC...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce potentially historic rainfall
totals of 10 to 20 inches, with maximum amounts of 25 inches,
bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of southeast
Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina, and southeast North
Carolina through Friday.
 
From northern North Carolina through portions of the Mid-Atlantic
States, 4 to 8 inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 12 inches,
are expected through Sunday morning. This rainfall will likely
result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with river
flooding possible.
 
An additional scattered 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, with maximum
amounts of 4 inches is possible across western portion of the
Central Florida Peninsula today which may aggravate any ongoing
flooding conditions across that vicinity.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with  Debby, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over coastal South Carolina
tonight through early Wednesday morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida through tonight.  Swells will continue to
affect the Southeast U.S. coast through the end of the week.
These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
