HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue over portions of the
tropical storm warning area along the Florida Gulf coast for the 
next few hours, and have begun along portions of the tropical storm 
warning area along the Atlantic coast.  Tropical storm conditions 
are expected along the coast of South Carolina within the 
tropical storm warning area by late tonight or early Tuesday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Yankeetown, FL to Aucilla River, FL...3-5 ft
Aripeka, FL to Yankeetown, FL...2-4 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee River, SC...2-4 ft

For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12
inches, with maximum amounts of 18 inches, across portions of
central and northern Florida as well as central and northeast North
Carolina through Wednesday morning.  This rainfall will likely
result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with
significant river flooding expected.
 
Across portions of southeast Georgia, the coastal plain of South
Carolina, and southeast North Carolina, 10 to 20 inches of rainfall,
with local amounts to 30 inches, are expected through Saturday
morning.  This potentially historic rainfall will likely result in
areas of catastrophic flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Debby, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over central and northern
Florida and southeastern Georgia today.  The threat will spread
northeastward into parts of South Carolina later today and tonight.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida through tonight.  Swells will begin to affect
the Southeast U.S. coast later today and continue through the
middle of the week. These conditions are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
