HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce an additional 1 to
3 inches of rainfall with locally higher amounts, across coastal
portions of North Carolina today, with locally considerable flooding
expected.
 
Across eastern Pennsylvania into Upstate New York, an additional 1
to 3 inches of rainfall with locally higher amounts are expected
through Friday night. This will likely result in areas of
considerable flash and urban flooding, as well as river flooding.
 
For portions of Northern New England, 1 to 3 inches of rain with
locally higher amounts are expected through Friday night. This will
result in isolated to scattered instances of flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with  Debby, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of

the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two may occur through this evening across
portions of New Jersey, New York, and western New England.
 
WIND: Wind gusts of 30-50 MPH will be possible into tonight
across portions of Delaware, eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
New York, and western New England. Given saturated ground
conditions these winds may bring down trees and
result in isolated to scattered power outages.
 
SURF:  Large swells will continue to affect the Southeast,
Mid-Atlantic and Southern New England coast. These conditions are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
