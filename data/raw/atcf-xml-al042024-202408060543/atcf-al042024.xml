DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located near latitude 31.2 North, longitude 81.9 West. Debby is
moving toward the northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A turn toward the
east is expected today, followed by a turn to the north at a
slow forward speed on Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center
will move across southeastern Georgia this morning, and then off the
Georgia coast later today and on Wednesday, and approach the South 
Carolina coast on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some slight weakening is possible today.  Some 
re-strengthening is possible on Wednesday and Thursday when
Debby is off the southeastern U.S. coast.
 
Recent satellite-derived wind data and surface observations 
indicate that tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 200 
miles (320 km) east of the center.  A weather station on Tybee 
Island, Georgia, recently reported a sustained wind of 43 mph (69 
km/h) and a gust to 54 mph (87 km/h).  A station on Folly Island, 
South Carolina, recently reported a sustained wind of 41 mph (67 
km/h) and a gust to 52 mph (83 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
tropical storm warning area along the Florida and Georgia Atlantic
coast through this morning.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected along the coast of South Carolina within the tropical
storm warning area by this morning.  Tropical storm conditions are 
possible within the tropical storm watch area in North Carolina 
beginning Wednesday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to Cape Fear, NC...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce potentially historic
rainfall totals of 10 to 20 inches, with maximum amounts of 30
inches, bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of
eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina, and southeast
North Carolina through Wednesday.  Across portions of central and
northeast North Carolina, 6 to 12 inches of rainfall, with local
amounts to 18 inches, are expected through Saturday morning. This
rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable flash and urban
flooding, with significant river flooding expected.
 
An additional scattered 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, with maximum
amounts of 4 inches is possible across western portions of the
Central Florida Peninsula which may aggravate any ongoing flooding
conditions across that area.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with  Debby, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over southeastern Georgia
and coastal South Carolina tonight through today.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida through tonight.  Swells will continue to
affect the Southeast U.S. coast through the middle of the week.
These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
