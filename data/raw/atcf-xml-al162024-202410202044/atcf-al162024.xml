DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Oscar was located 
near latitude 20.5 North, longitude 74.3 West. Oscar is moving 
toward the west-southwest near 6 mph (9 km/h). A continued 
west-southwestward motion at a slow forward speed is expected 
through tonight, followed by a turn toward the northwest and north 
on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Oscar 
is expected to make landfall along the northern coast of eastern 
Cuba shortly. The system is then expected to move across eastern 
Cuba tonight and Monday.  Oscar is then forecast to begin moving a 
bit faster to the northeast across the central Bahamas on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts. After Oscar makes landfall, significant weakening is 
expected, but Oscar could still be a tropical storm when it moves 
north of Cuba late Monday and then moves across the central Bahamas 
on Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles 
(75 km). Recently, there was a wind gust of 63 mph (101 km/h) from 
a weather station in Punta Maisi on the eastern tip of Cuba. 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches). A 
weather station in Punta Maisi on the eastern tip of Cuba recently 
reported a minimum pressure of 998 mb (29.47 inches).
