WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
All Hurricane and Tropical Storm warnings have been discontinued
along the Florida east coast south of the Flagler/Volusia county
line, and along the Florida west coast south of the mouth of the
Suwannee River.
 
The Hurricane Warning for the Florida coast from the mouth of the
Suwannee Rover to Mexico Beach has been changed to a Tropical Storm
Warning.
 
The Tropical Storm Warning has been discontinued for the Florida
Gulf coast west of Indian Pass.
 
The Storm Surge Warning for the Florida coast has been discontinued
west of Indian Pass and south of Bonita Beach.
 
The Hurricane Watch for the Florida West coast has been
discontinued.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Storm Surge Warning is in effect for...
* Indian Pass to Bonita Beach
* Tampa Bay
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The mouth of the Suwannee River to Indian Pass
* The Flagler/Volusia county line northward to Little River Inlet
 
A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline. For
a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.  Persons
located within these areas should take all necessary actions to
protect life and property from rising water and the potential for
other dangerous conditions.  Promptly follow evacuation and other
instructions from local officials.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United States, 
including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor 
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast 
office. 

 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Helene was
located near latitude 32.8 North, longitude 83.0 West. Helene is
moving toward the north near 30 mph (48 km/h).  A turn toward the
north is expected this morning, taking the center over central and
northeastern Georgia.  After that, Helene is expected to turn 
northwestward and slow down over the Tennessee Valley later today 
and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is expected, and Helene is 
expected to become a post-tropical low this afternoon or tonight. 
However, the fast forward speed will allow strong, damaging winds, 
especially in gusts, to penetrate well inland across the 
southeastern United States, including over the higher terrain of
the southern Appalachians.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275 miles (445 km)
mainly to the east of the center.  The Marine Corp Air Station at 
Beaufort, South Carolina, recently reported a wind gust of 75 mph 
(120 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure based on surface observations is 968 
mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Aucilla River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...5-10 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...4-7 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Aucilla River, FL...3-6 ft
Anclote River, FL to Englewood, FL...3-5 ft
Tampa Bay...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring from northern Florida
through eastern Georgia into southern South Carolina, and these
conditions will continue spreading northward across the tropical
storm warning areas in the Southeastern U.S. through today.
Strong, damaging winds, especially in gusts, will likely penetrate
as far inland as the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians.
 
RAINFALL: Over portions of the Southeastern U.S. into the Southern
Appalachians, Helene is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 6 to 12 inches, with isolated totals around 20 inches. This
rainfall will likely result in catastrophic and potentially
life-threatening flash and urban flooding, along with significant
and record river flooding. Numerous significant landslides are
expected in steep terrain across the southern Appalachians.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated
this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the
WMO header ACUS44 KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: Tornadoes are possible this morning over parts of eastern
Georgia, and through this afternoon over the Carolinas and southern
Virginia.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect much of Florida and
the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas during the next couple of
days.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
