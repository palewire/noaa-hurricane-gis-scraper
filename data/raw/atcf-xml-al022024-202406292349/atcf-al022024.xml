DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located 
near latitude 10.2 North, longitude 50.3 West. Beryl is moving 
quickly toward the west near 22 mph (35 km/h). A continued quick 
westward to west-northwestward motion is expected during the next 
few days. On the forecast track, the center of Beryl is expected to 
move across the Windward Islands late Sunday night and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Continued steady to rapid strengthening is
forecast, and Beryl is expected to become a dangerous major
hurricane before it reaches the Windward Islands.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60
miles (95 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning 
area beginning Sunday night. Devastating wind damage is expected 
where the eyewall of Beryl moves through portions of the Windward 
Islands.

Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning 
area starting Sunday night, making outside preparations difficult or 
dangerous.

Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area starting Sunday night. 

Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains
are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be
even greater.
 
STORM SURGE:  A life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels
by as much as 5 to 7 feet above normal tide levels in areas of
onshore flow near where Beryl makes landfall in the hurricane
warning and watch areas.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 3 to 6
inches across Barbados and the Windward Islands Sunday night into
Monday. This rainfall may cause flooding in vulnerable areas.
 
Showers and thunderstorms well north of Beryl may produce 1 to 4
inches of rain over portions of southeastern Puerto Rico Monday
night into Tuesday.
 
Rainfall from Beryl may impact portions of southern Hispaniola
Tuesday into Wednesday, with 2 to 6 inches of rain possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Beryl, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Beryl are expected to reach the Windward 
and southern Leeward Islands by late Sunday.  These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.
