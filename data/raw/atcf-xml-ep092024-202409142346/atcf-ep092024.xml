--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Altata to Huatabampito Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within
12 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Sonora 
should closely monitor the progress of Ileana.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM MST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ileana was 
located near latitude 25.4 North, longitude 109.0 West. Ileana is 
drifting toward the south near 2 mph (3 km/h). A turn toward the 
northwest is expected later tonight or on Sunday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Ileana will move near, over the coastal region 
of northern Sinaloa during the next several hours, and then move 
over the Gulf of California roughly parallel to the coast on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Weakening is forecast to begin this evening, and Ileana is likely to 
degenerate into a remnant low tonight or on Sunday.  The remnant low 
is expected to dissipate by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center. The Mexican Navy station at Topolobampo recently
reported sustained winds of 44 mph (71 km/h) and a wind gust of 55
mph (89 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).

evening.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ileana will affect portions of the
Gulf of California coasts of Sinaloa, southern Sonora, and southern
Baja California Sur during the next day or so.  These swells could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
