DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM CST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rafael was
located near latitude 26.1 North, longitude 91.8 West. Rafael is
moving toward the north-northwest near 2 mph (4 km/h). The storm is
expected to meander over the central Gulf of Mexico through tonight, 
then turn toward the south and south-southwest on Monday and 
Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Weakening is expected through early next week, 
and Rafael is forecast to degenerate to a post-tropical remnant low 
by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Rafael can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael will continue impacting portions of
the northern and western Gulf Coast through the weekend. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Indirect rainfall associated with the moisture from Rafael 
is expected to lead to additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 
inches, with local totals to 15 inches, across portions of 
southwestern and central Louisiana into this afternoon.  This rain 
could lead to or continue significant flash flooding.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
