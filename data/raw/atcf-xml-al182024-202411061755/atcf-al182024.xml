DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM EST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was located
near latitude 22.0 North, longitude 82.3 West. Rafael is moving
toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A general northwestward
motion is anticipated over the next day or so, followed by a gradual
west-northwestward turn in the Gulf of Mexico. On the forecast
track, Rafael is expected make landfall in western Cuba this 
afternoon.  Rafael is forecast to move into the southeastern Gulf
of Mexico tonight.
 
Satellite data and preliminary reports from an Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicated that the maximum sustained winds 
have increased to near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher gusts. Some 
additional strengthening is likely before Rafael makes landfall in 
Cuba this afternoon.  Rafael is forecast to weaken over Cuba but is 
expected to emerge into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico as a 
hurricane.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km). An automated weather station at Cayo Largo Del Sur, 
Cuba, reported sustained winds of 58 mph (93 km/h) with a gust to 
83 mph (134 km/h) within the past few hours. 
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force reconnaissance 
aircraft data is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in western Cuba and the
Isle of Youth through the evening.  Tropical storm conditions are 
expected in parts of west-central Cuba and the lower and middle 
Florida Keys today and tonight.  
 
RAINFALL: Heavy rainfall will impact areas of the Western Caribbean 
through early Thursday, particularly across the Cayman Islands into 
western Cuba. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are expected across 
portions of western Cuba, with isolated higher totals up to 12 
inches anticipated across areas of higher terrain. This will lead 
to areas of flash flooding and mudslides. Across the Cayman Islands 
additional rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected.
 
Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected for the Lower and
Middle Florida Keys.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Rafael, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels as much as 9 to
14 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the southern coast of Cuba in the Hurricane Warning area, including
the Isle of Youth.
 
The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally
dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving
inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the following
heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Lower Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
TORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes are possible through tonight over
the Florida Keys and far southwestern Florida mainland.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to affect much of the
western Caribbean during the next day or so and will also spread
across most of the Gulf of Mexico from east to west late this week
into the weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
