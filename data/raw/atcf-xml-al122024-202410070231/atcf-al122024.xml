DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located
near latitude 38.6 North, longitude 43.6 West. Kirk is moving toward
the northeast near 25 mph (41 km/h).  An even faster 
east-northeastward motion is expected during the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Although gradual weakening is expected, Kirk is forecast to 
become a large and strong extratropical low during the next couple 
of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310
miles (500 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 964 mb (28.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Bermuda, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the east coast of the
United States, portions of Atlantic Canada, and the Azores. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
