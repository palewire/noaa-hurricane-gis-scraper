WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The Storm Surge Warning has been discontinued between Grand Isle, 
Louisiana and the mouth of the Pearl River

The Tropical Storm Warning has been discontinued for the coasts of 
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, including Lake Maurepas, Lake 
Pontchartrain, and metropolitan New Orleans. 
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Storm Surge Warning is in effect for...
* The mouth of the Pearl River to the Mississippi/Alabama Border
* Lake Maurepas
* Lake Pontchartrain
 
A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline.
 
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.  
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression 
Francine was located near latitude 31.9 North, longitude 90.1 West. 
Francine is moving toward the north-northeast near 12 mph (19 
km/h). A turn toward the north is expected during the next day or 
so, with some decrease in forward speed. On the forecast track, the 
center of Francine will move over central and northern portions of 
Mississippi through early Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast, and Francine is 
expected to become a post-tropical cyclone later today.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Francine can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Wind gusts to tropical-storm force are possible for the next 
several hours over portions of southeastern Louisiana, southeastern 
and central Mississippi, and southwestern Alabama.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 3 to
6 inches across portions of Mississippi, eastern Arkansas,
Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle. Localized
amounts up to 10 inches are possible within rain bands over portions
of central and northern Alabama and over the Florida Panhandle. This
rainfall could lead to locally considerable flash and urban
flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS1 with the WMO header ACUS41
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mouth of the Pearl River, LA to MS/AL Border...2-4 ft
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to 
your area, please see products issued by your local National 
Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible today, mainly this morning 
and afternoon from the Florida Panhandle to north-central Alabama.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine will continue to affect much of
the northern Gulf coast through today. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
