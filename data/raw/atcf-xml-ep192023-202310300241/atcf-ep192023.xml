DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was 
located near latitude 11.0 North, longitude 92.0 West. Pilar is 
moving toward the east-northeast near 5 mph (7 km/h) and a continued 
east-northeastward motion is anticipated for the next couple of 
days.  On the forecast track, Pilar could be near the coast 
of El Salvador on Tuesday night or early Wednesday, though the core 
of the system is forecast to stay offshore.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast over the 
next couple of days, and Pilar could be near hurricane strength by 
Tuesday. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Pilar is expected to produce storm total 
rainfall of 5 to 10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, in and 
around much of the Pacific coast of Central America, including the 
country of El Salvador, through Wednesday.  This rainfall will 
produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of 
higher terrain.

SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to reach portions of 
the Pacific coast of Central America on Monday. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical
Storm Watch area early on Tuesday.
