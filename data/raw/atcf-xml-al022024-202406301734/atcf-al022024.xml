DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 10.9 North, longitude 55.6 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west near 21 mph (33 km/h). A continued quick westward to
west-northwestward motion is expected during the next few days. On
the forecast track, the center of Beryl is expected to move across
the Windward Islands Monday morning and across the southeastern and
central Caribbean Sea late Monday through Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Beryl is an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Beryl is expected to remain a 
category 4 hurricane as it moves through Windward Islands.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from the NOAA and Air
Force Hurricane Hunters is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area beginning early Monday morning.  Potentially catastrophic wind
damage is expected where the eyewall of Beryl moves through portions
of the Windward Islands, with the highest risk of the core in St.
Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada.
 
Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains
are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be
even greater.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area starting late tonight, making outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
starting late tonight.
 
STORM SURGE:  A life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels
by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of
onshore flow near where the eye makes landfall in the hurricane
warning area.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of
3 to 6 inches across Barbados and the Windward Islands through
Monday. Localized maxima of 10 inches is possible, especially in the
Grenadines. This rainfall may cause flash flooding in vulnerable
areas.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are expected across
Windward and southern Leeward Islands during the next couple of
days.  Swells are also expected to reach the southern coasts 
of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola in the next day or so. These swells 
are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
