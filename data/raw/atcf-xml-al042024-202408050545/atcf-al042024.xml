DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Debby was located
near latitude 29.1 North, longitude 83.8 West. Debby is moving
toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A gradual decrease in
forward speed with a turn toward the northeast and east is expected
later today and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center will 
reach the Florida Big Bend coast later this morning.  Debby is then 
expected to move slowly across northern Florida and southern 
Georgia late today and Tuesday, and be near the Georgia coast by 
Tuesday night.
 
Data from Air Force reconnaissance aircraft indicate that maximum 
sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher gusts.  
Additional strengthening is likely before Debby reaches the Florida 
Big Bend coast later this morning.  Weakening is expected after 
Debby moves inland.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from reconnaissance aircraft
data is 981 mb (28.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning 
area later this morning. Tropical storm conditions will continue to 
spread northward over the tropical storm warning area along the 
Florida Gulf coast through the morning, and begin along portions of 
the tropical storm warning area along the Atlantic coast by this 
evening. Tropical storm conditions are expected along the coast of 
South Carolina within the tropical storm warning area by late 
tonight.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Yankeetown, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...6-10 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Yankeetown, FL...4-6 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Indian Pass, FL...4-6 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...3-5 ft
Tampa Bay...3-5 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee River, SC...2-4 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Debby is expected to produce rainfall totals of 
6 to 12 inches, with maximum amounts of 18 inches, across portions 
of central and northern Florida and southeastern North Carolina 
through Friday morning.  This rainfall will likely result in areas 
of considerable flash and urban flooding, with significant river 
flooding expected.
 
Across portions of southeast Georgia and South Carolina, 10 to 20
inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 30 inches, are expected
through Friday morning.  This potentially historic rainfall will
likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Debby, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over central and northern
Florida and southern Georgia today.  The threat will spread 
northeastward into coastal Georgia and parts of South
Carolina later today.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida through tonight.  Swells will begin to affect
the Southeast U.S. coast later today and continue through the 
middle of the week. These conditions are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
