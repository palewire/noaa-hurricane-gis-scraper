Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours. 
Strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and Hone is

expected to be strongest where they blow downslope from higher
terrain, over headlands, and through passes.

of 2 to 4 inches will be possible over portions of the smaller
islands, mainly windward.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Hone will begin
impact eastern portions of the Hawaiian Islands later tonight,
then spread to the remainder of the state through the rest of
