DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 47.3 North, longitude 50.0 West.  Ernesto is
moving toward the northeast near 36 mph (57 km/h).  An even faster
motion to the northeast or east-northeast is expected during the
next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Ernesto
will move over the open North Atlantic today and tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast, and 
Ernesto should lose its tropical characteristics later today, 
and dissipate on Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).

SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting Bermuda, the
northeast coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada. The

conditions should gradually subside during the next day or so.
Please consult products from your local weather office, and stay out
of the water if advised by lifeguards.
