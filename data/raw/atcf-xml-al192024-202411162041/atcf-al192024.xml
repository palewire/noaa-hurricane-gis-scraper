DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Sara was 
located near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 87.0 West. Sara is 
moving toward the west near 5 mph (7 km/h), and a general westward 
to west-northwestward motion is expected to continue until 
landfall. On the forecast track, the center of Sara will approach 
Belize tonight before moving onshore over Belize during the day on 
Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Only minor fluctuations in intensity are expected before landfall 
in Belize on Sunday, with weakening expected after landfall. Sara 
is expected to open up into a trough on Sunday night or Monday as 
its remnants move into the southern Gulf of Mexico. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from aircraft dropsonde 
observations is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).

Guatemala, western Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo,
Tropical Storm Sara is expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain
with localized totals around 15 inches through early next week. This
will result in areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along
with the potential of mudslides.
