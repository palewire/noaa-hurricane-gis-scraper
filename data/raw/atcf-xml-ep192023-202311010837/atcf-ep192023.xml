proximity to the coast of Central America through this morning, but 
the core of the storm is expected to remain offshore.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC

RAINFALL:  Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, for portions of Central
America from southern El Salvador, across southern Honduras, western
Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica through today. This rainfall will

the Pacific coast of Central America during the next couple of days.
