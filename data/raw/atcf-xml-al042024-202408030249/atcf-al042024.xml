A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the

For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Four 
was located near latitude 21.4 North, longitude 79.7 West.  The 
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 17 mph (28 
km/h).  A turn toward the northwest is forecast on Saturday, 
followed by a slower motion toward the north and then the northeast 
on Sunday and Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of the 
depression will move across Cuba overnight and on Saturday, and then 
move generally northward over the eastern Gulf of Mexico Saturday 
and Sunday, potentially reaching the Florida Gulf coast late Sunday 
or Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next several days, and the 
depression is expected to become a tropical storm on Saturday and 
continue strengthening over the eastern Gulf of Mexico through the 
weekend.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1010 mb (29.83 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WINDS: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
late Saturday and Saturday night.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the watch area in the Florida Keys and the southern
Florida peninsula by Saturday or Saturday night. Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the watch area along the Florida west
coast Saturday night and Sunday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Bonita Beach, FL to Suwannee River, FL...2-4 ft
Tampa Bay...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Card Sound Bridge, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...1-3 ft
Dry Tortugas...1-2 ft
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Four is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 4 to 8 inches, with maximum rainfall totals up to 12
inches, across portions of Florida and along the Southeast U.S.
coast this weekend through Wednesday. This rainfall may result in
areas of locally considerable flash and urban flooding, with
isolated river flooding possible.

For Cuba, rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches, with localized higher 
amounts, will be possible through Saturday. This may result in 
isolated to scattered areas of flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Depression Four, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two is possible across the Florida Keys and
the western Florida Peninsula Saturday night through Sunday morning.
