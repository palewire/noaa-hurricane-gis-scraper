SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Storm Surge Watch is in effect for...
* High Island Texas to the Mississippi/Alabama Border
* Vermilion Bay
* Lake Maurepas
* Lake Pontchartrain
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...

A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.

A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was 
located near latitude 23.0 North, longitude 94.9 West. Francine is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h) and a slow 
north-northwestward motion is expected for the remainder of the day, 
followed by a faster motion to the northeast beginning on Tuesday. 
On the forecast track, Francine is expected to be just offshore of 
the northern Gulf Coast of Mexico through Tuesday, and approach the 
Louisiana and Upper Texas coastline on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Gradual intensification is expected over the next day with 
more significant intensification on Tuesday Night and Wednesday. 
Francine is expected to become a hurricane before it reaches the 
northwestern U.S. Gulf Coast on Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Francine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.

WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by
Wednesday afternoon, with tropical storm conditions possible by 
Wednesday morning.

Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area along 
the northern coast of Mexico and extreme southern Texas beginning 
Tuesday, and for the extreme northern Texas and portions of the 
Louisiana coast on Wednesday. 

RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Francine is expected to bring storm 
total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches, 
from the coast of far northeast Mexico northward along portions of 
the southern Texas coast, the far upper Texas coast and across 
southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi into Thursday morning. 
This rainfall could lead to the risk of considerable flash and urban 
flooding. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Storm Francine, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cameron, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
High Island, TX to Cameron, LA...3-5 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to 
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be 
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding 
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and 
can vary greatly over short distances. Storm surge is not expected 
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees. However, there 
may be some overtopping of local levees. For information specific 
to your area, please see products issued by your local National 
Weather Service forecast office.

Minor coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Mexico in 
areas of onshore winds.

For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge 
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by this system are affecting portions of the
Gulf coast of Mexico and are expected to spread northwestward across
the northwestern Gulf of Mexico coastline through midweek.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
