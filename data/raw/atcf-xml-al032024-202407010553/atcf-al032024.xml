DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Chris was
located near latitude 20.0 North, longitude 96.7 West.  Chris is
moving toward the west near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this general
motion is expected during the next day or so.  On the forecast
track, the center of Chris will continue farther inland over 
eastern Mexico through today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Weakening is expected as Chris moves farther inland, and the system 
will likely dissipate over the higher terrain later today.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Chris is expected to produce rainfall 
totals of 4 to 8 inches across portions of eastern Mexico through

across the higher terrain of the Mexican states of Guanajuato, 
Queretaro, and San Luis Potosi.  This rainfall will result in areas 
of flooding, with mudslides possible in areas of higher terrain.
