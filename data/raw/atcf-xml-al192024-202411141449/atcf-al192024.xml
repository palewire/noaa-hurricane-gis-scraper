HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Tropical Depression Nineteen can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Through early next week, rainfall amounts of 10 
to 20 inches with isolated storm totals around 30 inches area 
expected over northern Honduras. This rainfall will lead to 
widespread areas of life-threatening and potentially catastrophic 
flash flooding and mudslides, especially along and near the Sierra 
La Esperanza.

Elsewhere across the rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern 
Guatemala, and western Nicaragua, Tropical Depression Nineteen is 
expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain with localized totals 
around 15 inches through early next week. This will result in areas 
of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along with the potential of 
mudslides.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Depression Nineteen, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at

areas of onshore winds along the northern coast of Honduras. Near
the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive
waves.
