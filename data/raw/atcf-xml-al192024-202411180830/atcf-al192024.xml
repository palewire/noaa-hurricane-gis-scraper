DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK

RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are expected
over northern Honduras, with storm total amounts locally as high as
40 inches. The risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flooding
impacts will continue, especially along and near the Sierra La
Esperanza.
 
Across portions of Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala, western 
Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo, the remnants of 
Sara are expected to produce an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain 
with localized storm totals around 15 inches. This will result in 
areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along with the 
potential of mudslides.
