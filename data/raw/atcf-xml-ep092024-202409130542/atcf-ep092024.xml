DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM MST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ileana was
located near latitude 21.2 North, longitude 108.6 West. Ileana is
moving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A slower
north-northwestward to northward motion is expected during the next
few days. On the forecast track, Ileana is expected to move across
the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula on Friday and
over the Gulf of California this weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Slight additional strengthening is possible before Ileana reaches 
the Baja California peninsula. However, weakening is expected to 
begin by late Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ileana can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Ileana is expected to produce 4-6 inches of rain with 
localized higher amounts up to 8 inches across the coastal areas of 
Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco through early Friday. From Friday 
through Sunday, Ileana may result in 4-6 inches, with localized 
higher amounts up to 8 inches, across southern Baja California. For 
northwest coastal Sinaloa, Ileana may produce between 6-8 inches 
with localized higher amounts up to 12 inches. This heavy rainfall 
will bring a risk of flash flooding and mudslides to portions of the 
area.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the 
coast of the southern Baja California Peninsula within the warning 
area Friday morning. Tropical storm conditions are possible within 
the watch area by early Saturday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ileana will affect portions of the coast 
of west-central Mexico and the coast of the southern Baja California 
Peninsula during the next couple of days. These swells are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
