DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was 
located near latitude 24.9 North, longitude 95.6 West. Francine is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A turn to 
the northeast with an increase in forward speed is expected later 
today or tonight.  On the forecast track, Francine is anticipated to 
be just offshore of the coasts of northeastern Mexico and southern 
Texas through this afternoon, and then move across the northwestern 
Gulf of Mexico, making landfall in Louisiana on Wednesday.  After 
landfall, the center is expected to move into Mississippi on 
Wednesday night or Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is expected through Wednesday morning, and 
Francine will likely become a hurricane later today or tonight.  
Francine is expected to weaken quickly after landfall.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure reported by NOAA and Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Francine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area on Wednesday. with tropical storm conditions arriving
in the warning area by early Wednesday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in Mexico
and south Texas for the next several hours.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible within the watch area along the
northeastern coast of Mexico for the next few hours. Tropical Storm
conditions are expected in the warning area along the Louisiana and
Mississippi coasts Wednesday and Wednesday night. Tropical storm
conditions are also possible along portions of the Texas coast in
the watch area today and tonight, and are possible in the watch area
on the Alabama coast on Wednesday and Wednesday night.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to
8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across much of Louisiana
and Mississippi through Friday morning. This rainfall could lead to
considerable flash and urban flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
Sabine Pass, TX to Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, LA...3-5 ft
Pointe a la Hache, LA to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft
Lake Pontchartrain...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
Minor coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Mexico in
areas of onshore winds.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible Wednesday morning through
Wednesday night over near-coastal areas of Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting portions of the
coast of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas.  These swells are
expected to spread across the northwestern and northern Gulf of
Mexico coastline during the next day or so.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
