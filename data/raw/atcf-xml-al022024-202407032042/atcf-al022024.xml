DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 17.5 North, longitude 77.6 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this general
motion should continue through this evening, followed by a turn 
more toward the west tonight or Thursday.  On the forecast track, 
the center of Beryl will pass near or over the southern coast of 
Jamaica during the next few  hours.  After that, the center is 
expected to pass near or over the Cayman Islands tonight or early 
Thursday and move over the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico Thursday 
night or early Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Beryl is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some weakening is forecast during the next
day or two.  However, Beryl is forecast to be at or near major
hurricane intensity while it passes the Cayman Islands.  Additional 
weakening is expected thereafter, though Beryl is forecast to 
remain a hurricane until it makes landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km). Kingston, Jamaica, recently reported sustained winds of 
48 mph (78 km/h) and a wind gust of 81 mph (130 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 959 mb (28.32 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are spreading across portions of
Jamaica at this time, especially along the southern coast and in
the mountainous areas.  Tropical storm conditions are occurring
elsewhere on the island.
 
Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains
are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be
even greater.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the Cayman Islands
tonight or early Thursday.  Winds are expected to first reach
tropical storm strength late this afternoon or early tonight,
making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area on
the Yucatan Peninsula Thursday night or early Friday morning.  Winds
are expected to first reach tropical storm strength by late
Thursday, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area
along the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula as early as late
Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area in the tropical storm warning area of the Yucatan Peninsula by
late Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm
watch area along portions of the coast of Belize by late Thursday
or early Friday, and in the tropical storm watch area along the
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula by Friday.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 6
to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the immediate coast of Jamaica.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the immediate
coast of the Cayman Islands.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet
above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the east coast of
the Yucatan Peninsula within the hurricane warning area.
 
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with localized amounts of 12 inches across Jamaica through
Wednesday evening, along with additional rainfall of 4 to 6 inches
over the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti. This heavy rainfall is expected
to cause life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
 
Beryl is also expected to bring rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches
over the Cayman Islands Wednesday night into Thursday. Over the
Yucatan Peninsula into northern Belize, Beryl is expected to produce
rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches with localized amounts of 8 inches
late Thursday through Friday. Scattered instances of flash flooding
are anticipated.

associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are currently impacting the
southern coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.  These
swells are expected to reach the coasts of Costa Rica, Nicaragua,
the Cayman Islands, and the south coast of Cuba this evening, and
they are expected to reach the coasts of Honduras, Belize, and the
Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico by midday Thursday. These swells are
expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
