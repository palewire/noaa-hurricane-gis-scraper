* Lake Pontchartrain
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Grand Isle, Louisiana to the Alabama/Florida border
* Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain, including metropolitan New
Orleans
 
A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline,
beginning shortly for the indicated locations.
 
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.  Persons
located within these areas should take all necessary actions to
protect life and property from rising water and the potential for
other dangerous conditions.  Promptly follow evacuation and other
instructions from local officials.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was
located near latitude 30.9 North, longitude 90.1 West. Francine is
moving toward the northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn toward 
the north-northeast and north is expected during the next day or 
so, with some decrease in forward speed. On the forecast track, the 
center of Francine will move over central and northern portions of 
Mississippi through early Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Continued weakening is forecast, and Francine is expected to become 
a tropical depression this morning and degenerate to a post-tropical 
cyclone today.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km) 
from the center. A National Ocean Service weather station at 
Southwest Pass, Louisiana recently reported a wind gust of 39 mph 
(63 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Francine can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions, especially in gusts, are expected 
to continue in portions of the warning area for the next few hours.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 3 to
6 inches across portions of Mississippi, eastern Arkansas,
Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle. Localized
amounts up to 10 inches are possible within rain bands over portions
of central and northern Alabama and over the Florida Panhandle. This
rainfall could lead to locally considerable flash and urban
flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS1 with the WMO header ACUS41
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mouth of the Pearl River, LA to Ocean Springs, MS...4-6 ft
Lake Pontchartrain...4-6 ft
Ocean Springs, MS to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft
Lake Maurepas...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible today, mainly in the
morning and afternoon from the Florida Panhandle to north-central
Alabama.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine will continue to affect much of
the northern Gulf coast through today. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
