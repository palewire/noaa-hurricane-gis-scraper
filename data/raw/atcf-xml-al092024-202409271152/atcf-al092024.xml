WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Tropical Storm Warning along the Florida Gulf Coast from the 
mouth of the Suwannee River to Indian Pass has been discontinued.  
The Tropical Storm Warning along the east coast of Florida and 
extreme southeastern Georgia from the Flagler/Volusia County Line 
to Altamaha Sound has been discontinued.

The Storm Surge Warning for the Florida coast has been discontinued
south of the Middle of Longboat Key.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Storm Surge Warning is in effect for...
* Indian Pass to Middle of Longboat Key, Florida 
* Tampa Bay
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Altamaha Sound northward to Little River Inlet
 
A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline. For
a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.  
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. 
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Helene was
located near latitude 34.2 North, longitude 83.0 West. Helene is
moving toward the north near 30 mph (48 km/h).  Helene is expected 
to turn northwestward and slow down over the Tennessee Valley later 
today and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is expected, and Helene is
expected to become a post-tropical low this afternoon or tonight.
However, damaging wind gusts will penetrate far inland across the
southeastern United States, including over the higher terrain of the
southern Appalachians.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275 miles (445 km)
mainly to the east of the center.  An observation in Brasstown 
Bald, Georgia recently reported a wind gust of 72 mph (116 km/h).  
An observation in Dewees Island, South Carolina, recently reported 
a sustained wind of 46 mph (74 km/h) and a gust of 62 mph (100 
km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure based on surface observations is 
972 mb (28.70 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Aucilla River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...5-10 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Aucilla River, FL...3-6 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring along much of the 
Georgia and South Carolina coasts, and these conditions will 
continue for the next several hours. Strong, damaging winds, 
especially in gusts, will also continue as far inland as the higher 
terrain of the southern Appalachians.
 
RAINFALL: Over portions of the Southeastern U.S. into the Southern
Appalachians, Helene is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 6 to 12 inches, with isolated totals around 20 inches. This
rainfall will likely result in catastrophic and potentially
life-threatening flash and urban flooding, along with significant
and record river flooding. Numerous significant landslides are
expected in steep terrain across the southern Appalachians.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated
this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the
WMO header ACUS44 KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: Tornadoes are possible this morning over parts of eastern
Georgia, and through this afternoon over the Carolinas and southern
Virginia.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect the coasts of Georgia 
and the Carolinas during the next day or so.  These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.
