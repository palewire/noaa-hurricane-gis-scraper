the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds, 
conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 22.4 North, longitude 68.7 West. Ernesto is
moving toward the northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h). A turn toward
the north-northwest and north is expected tonight and on Thursday. A
northward to northeastward motion at a slower forward speed is
expected Friday and Saturday. On the forecast track, the center of
Ernesto is expected to pass near Bermuda on Saturday.
 
Data from Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that 
maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next couple 
of days, and Ernesto could become a major hurricane by Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches) 
based on Hurricane Hunter aircraft data.

WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible on Bermuda Saturday, with
tropical storm conditions possible by Friday afternoon.
 
RAINFALL: Ernesto is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 3 to 6 inches on Bermuda with isolated maximum amounts of 9
inches. This rainfall may result in considerable life-threatening
flash flooding.
 
Rainfall is expected to diminish this evening across Puerto Rico and 
the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. Total rainfall amounts from 
Ernesto are expected to be in the 6 to 10 inch range, with maximum 
amounts of 12 inches across southern to eastern Puerto Rico, 3 to 6 
inches across northwestern Puerto Rico, and 4 to 6 inches across the 
U.S and British Virgin Islands.

SURF: Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the 
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the 
Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the 
southeastern Bahamas. These swells will spread toward Bermuda and 
the rest of the Bahamas on Thursday. Swells are expected to reach 
the east coast of the United States Thursday night and continue into 
the weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
