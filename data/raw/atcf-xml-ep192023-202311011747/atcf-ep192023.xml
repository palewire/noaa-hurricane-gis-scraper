HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Pilar is expected to produce additional rainfall of 2 to
4 inches, with local amounts to 6 inches, for portions of Central
America from southern El Salvador, across southern Honduras, western
Nicaragua, and northern Costa Rica through today. The additional
rainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding, along with
mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next couple of days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the Tropical
Storm Watch area in El Salvador through this afternoon.
