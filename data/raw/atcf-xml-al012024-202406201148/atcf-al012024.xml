WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio
Grande to Tecolutla.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case through
this morning.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alberto was 
located near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 98.3 West. Alberto is 
moving toward the west near 13 mph (20 km/h). This motion is 
expected to continue through today, as Alberto moves further inland 
over Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Weakening is anticipated as Alberto continues to move inland, and 
the storm is likely to dissipate over Mexico later today or tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 250 miles (400 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Alberto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall associated with Tropical Storm Alberto is
expected to begin to diminish across southern Texas during the day,
with additional rainfall totals of 1 inch or less expected.  Heavy
rainfall will continue to impact northeast Mexico through this
morning, with rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches expected.  Maximum
rainfall totals around 20 inches are possible across the higher
terrain of the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and
Tamaulipas. This rainfall will likely produce considerable flash
and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding.
Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across
northeast Mexico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Alberto, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Sargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft
Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft
Sabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast of northeastern
Mexico in areas of onshore winds north of where the center makes
landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large
and destructive waves.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area through this morning.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two could occur this morning across parts
of Deep South Texas.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Alberto will affect the coast of Texas
and northeastern Mexico through Friday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
