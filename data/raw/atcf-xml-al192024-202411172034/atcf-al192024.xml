Further weakening is expected, and Sara is expected to become a 
remnant low or open up into a trough over the southern portion of

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Tropical Depression Sara can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are expected
over northern Honduras, with storm total amounts locally as high as
40 inches. The risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flooding
impacts will continue, especially along and near the Sierra La
Esperanza.
 
Across portions of Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala, western
Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo, Tropical
Depression Sara is expected to produce an additional 3 to 5 inches
of rain with localized storm totals around 15 inches. This will
result in areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along with
the potential of mudslides.
