HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue along the
coast of South Carolina within the tropical storm warning area
through Thursday night.  Tropical storm conditions are expected
within the tropical storm warning area in North Carolina beginning
early Wednesday.  Tropical Storm conditions are possible within the
Tropical Storm Watch area in North Carolina beginning Wednesday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
South Santee River, SC to Cape Fear, NC...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce potentially historic storm
total rainfall of 10 to 20 inches, with maximum amounts of 25
inches, bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of
eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday.
 
From central South Carolina to the Upstate of South Carolina,
northward into Southwest Virginia,  portions of the Mid-Atlantic
States, western and northern New York State into Northern New
England, 3 to 6 inches with local amounts to 8 inches, are expected
through Saturday. This rainfall will likely result in areas of
considerable flash and urban flooding, with river flooding possible.
 
An additional scattered 1 to 3 inches of rainfall is possible across
southeast Georgia through tonight, which may aggravate any ongoing 
flooding conditions across that vicinity.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with  Debby, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44
KWBC or at the following link:

TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over portions of coastal
South Carolina and North Carolina through Wednesday morning.
 
SURF:  Large swells will continue to affect the Southeast U.S.
coast through the end of the week. These conditions are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
