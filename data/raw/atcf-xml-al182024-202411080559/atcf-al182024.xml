DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 AM CST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was 
located near latitude 24.7 North, longitude 87.5 West. Rafael is 
moving toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h), and a general westward 
to west-northwestward motion at a slower forward speed is expected 
through the weekend. On the forecast track, Rafael is expected to 
move over the central Gulf of Mexico for the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 120 mph (195 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rafael is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some additional strengthening 
is possible today. A weakening trend is forecast to begin late 
tonight and continue through the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to spread across most
of the Gulf of Mexico during the next several days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
