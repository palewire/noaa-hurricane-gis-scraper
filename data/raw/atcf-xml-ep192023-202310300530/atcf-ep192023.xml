DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 11.2 North, longitude 91.7 West. Pilar is
moving toward the east-northeast near 5 mph (7 km/h) and a continued
east-northeastward motion is anticipated for the next couple of
days.  On the forecast track, Pilar could be near the coast of El
Salvador on Tuesday night or early Wednesday, though the core of the
system is forecast to stay offshore.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Gradual strengthening is forecast over the next couple of 
days, and Pilar could be near hurricane strength on Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Pilar is expected to produce storm total
rainfall of 5 to 10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, in and
around much of the Pacific coast of Central America, including the
country of El Salvador, through Wednesday.  This rainfall will
produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of
higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to reach portions of
the Pacific coast of Central America later today. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical
Storm Watch area early on Tuesday.
