DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Otis was located
near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 100.6 West.  Otis is moving
toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this general
motion is expected through early tonight.  On the forecast track,
the center of Otis will continue to move farther inland over
southern Mexico through tonight.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Continued rapid weakening is expected while Otis
moves farther inland over the mountains of Mexico.  Otis will
likely dissipate over southern Mexico tonight.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles
(95 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).

southern Mexico near the center of Otis this morning, with the
strongest winds atop and on the windward sides of hills and

STORM SURGE:  Storm surge and waves along the southern coast of
Mexico are gradually subsiding.

RAINFALL:  Otis is expected to produce additional rainfall totals of
4-6 inches (locally as high as 8) through Thursday across Guerrero
and the western coastal sections of Oaxaca.  This rainfall will
produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of
higher terrain.

subside today.
