DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 10.7 North, longitude 53.1 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west near 21 mph (33 km/h).  A continued quick
westward to west-northwestward motion is expected during the next
few days. On the forecast track, the center of Beryl is expected to
move across the Windward Islands early on Monday and across the
southeastern Caribbean Sea on Monday night and Tuesday.
 
Satellite estimates indicate that the maximum sustained winds have
increased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher gusts.  Rapid
strengthening is forecast over the next day or so, and Beryl is
expected to become an extremely dangerous hurricane before it 
reaches the Windward Islands.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area beginning early on Monday.  Devastating wind damage is expected
where the eyewall of Beryl moves through portions of the Windward
Islands.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area starting tonight, making outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
starting tonight.
 
Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains
are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be
even greater.
 
STORM SURGE:  A life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels
by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of
onshore flow near where Beryl makes landfall in the hurricane
warning area.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.

RAINFALL:  Hurricane Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 
3 to 6 inches across Barbados and the Windward Islands Sunday night 
into Monday. This rainfall may cause flash flooding in vulnerable 
areas.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Beryl are expected to reach the Windward
and southern Leeward Islands by this evening.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
