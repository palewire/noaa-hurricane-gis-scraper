DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was 
located near latitude 27.0 North, longitude 84.3 West. Debby is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A turn 
toward the north is expected later today, followed by a slower 
motion toward the northeast on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast 
track, the center will move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico 
through tonight and reach the Florida Big Bend coast Monday morning. 
Debby is then expected to move slowly across northern Florida and 
southern Georgia Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Rapid strengthening is forecast, and Debby is 
expected to become a hurricane by tonight before it reaches the 
Florida Big Bend coast. Weakening is expected on Monday and Tuesday 
after Debby moves inland.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area and possible in the hurricane watch areas early Monday, with
tropical storm conditions expected to arrive this evening. Tropical
storm conditions are expected to spread northward over the tropical
storm warning areas through tonight. Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the watch area in the Florida Panhandle on Monday, and
along the coast of Georgia and South Carolina Monday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Suwannee River to Ochlockonee River, FL...6-10 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Suwannee River, FL...4-7 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Indian Pass, FL...4-6 ft
Tampa Bay...3-5 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...2-4 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee River, SC...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12
inches, with maximum amounts of 18 inches, across portions of
northern Florida through Friday morning.  This rainfall will likely
result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with
significant river flooding expected.
 
Across portions of southeast Georgia and South Carolina, 10 to 20
inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 30 inches, are expected
through Friday morning.  This potentially historic rainfall may
result in areas of catastrophic flooding.
 
For western Cuba, additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches, with
localized higher amounts, will be possible through today. This will
result in isolated to scattered areas of flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Debby, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible through Monday morning,
mainly over western and northern Florida and southern Georgia.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida through Monday.  Swells will begin to affect
the Southeast U.S. coast on Monday and continue through the middle
of the week. These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
