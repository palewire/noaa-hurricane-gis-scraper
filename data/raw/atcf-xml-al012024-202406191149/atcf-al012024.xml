WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* the Texas coast from San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the
Rio Grande
* the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio
Grande to Puerto de Altamira.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United States, 
including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor 
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast 
office. For storm information specific to your area outside of the 
United States, please monitor products issued by your national 
meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude
22.7 North, longitude 94.3 West.  The system is moving toward the
west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A generally westward motion
with an increase in forward speed is expected during the next day or
so, and the system is forecast to reach the coast of northeastern
Mexico by late tonight or early Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some increase in strength is possible before the system
reaches the coast.  The disturbance is forecast to become a tropical
storm later today.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.

The disturbance is quite large, and tropical-storm-force winds
extend outward up to 415 miles (665 km) to the north of the center. 
A WeatherFlow station at Matagorda Bay, Texas, recently reported a 
sustained wind of 38 mph (61 km/h) and a gust to 47 mph (76 km/h).

The minimum central pressure, based on data from NOAA buoy 42055, 
is 997 mb (29.44 inches).

A National Ocean Service tide station at San Luis Pass, Texas, 
recently reported a water level of 3.8 ft above Mean Higher High 
Water.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone One can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone One is expected to produce
rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South
Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible.  This rainfall
will likely produce considerable flash and urban flooding along
with new and renewed river flooding.  Mudslides are also possible
in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone One, please see the
National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Sargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft
Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft
Sabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
In Mexico, minor coastal flooding is possible north of where the
center of the system crosses the coast in areas of onshore
winds.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area today.
 
TORNADOES:  A couple of tornadoes are possible today and tonight
across parts of Deep South Texas and Southeast Texas.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the disturbance will affect the coast of
Texas and northeastern Mexico through early Thursday.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
