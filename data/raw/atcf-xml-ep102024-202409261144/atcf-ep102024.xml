DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane John was located 
near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 102.6 West. John is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 4 mph (7 km/h) and this motion is 
expected to continue today, followed by a gradual turn to the 
northwest by this evening.  On the forecast track, the center of 
John is forecast to approach and move along the coast of 
southwestern Mexico or just inland on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is expected until the 
center moves along the coast or inland on Friday, which should 
cause John to quickly weaken to a depression Friday night.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (15 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles 
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Through Friday, Hurricane John is expected to produce
additional rainfall amounts of 10 to 20 inches with isolated totals
around 30 inches across portions of the Mexican States of Guerrero,
Oaxaca and Michoacan.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with John,
please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding near and to the east of where the center makes landfall.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected along the coast within the
hurricane warning area by tonight or early Friday.  Winds are
expected to first reach tropical storm strength later this morning,
making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations
to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.
 
Tropical storm conditions are currently occurring over portions of
the coast within the tropical storm warning area, and should
continue through today.
 
SURF: Swells associated with John are forecast to continue to
affect the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico through the
week, with the potential for dangerous surf and rip currents.
Please see local statements for more information.
