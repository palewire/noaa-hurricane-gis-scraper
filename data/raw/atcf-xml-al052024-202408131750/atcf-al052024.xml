DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was
located near latitude 17.5 North, longitude 63.5 West.  Ernesto 
is moving toward the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue through tonight.  A motion
toward the northwest and then north at a slower forward speed is
expected on Wednesday and Thursday.  On the forecast track, the
center of Ernesto should pass near or over the Virgin Islands this
evening, and then pass just to the northeast and north of Puerto
Rico tonight and on Wednesday.  Ernesto should then move over the
western Atlantic later in the week.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, and
Ernesto is expected to become a hurricane by early Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.  A wind gust of 62 mph (100 km/h) was recently 
reported at Gustavia, St. Barthelemy.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 
1003 mb (29.62 inches).
