DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was
located near latitude 24.1 North, longitude 96.0 West. Francine is
moving toward the north-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A continued
north-northwest motion is expected through this evening followed by
a turn to the northeast with some acceleration beginning Tuesday. On
the forecast track, Francine is anticipated to be just offshore of
the coasts of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas through
Tuesday, and nearing the Louisiana and Upper Texas coastline on
Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Significant strengthening is forecast over the next couple 
of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from the Air Force 
Hurricane Hunters is 993 mb (29.32 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Francine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area on
Wednesday. Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch
area on Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions expected by
Wednesday morning within the warning areas.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in Mexico 
and south Texas through Tuesday afternoon. Tropical storm conditions 
are possible within the watch area along the northern coast of 
Mexico tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are also possible along 
portions of the Texas coast in the watch area Tuesday and Tuesday 
night, and are possible in the watch area in eastern Louisiana on 
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to
8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches, from the coast of
northeast Mexico northward over the far lower and far upper Texas
coasts, across southern Louisiana, and southern Mississippi into
Thursday morning. This rainfall could lead to the risk of
considerable flash and urban flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Francine, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cameron, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
High Island, TX to Cameron, LA...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA to MS/AL Border...2-4 ft
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to High Island, TX...1-3 ft
Galveston Bay...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances. Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees. However, there
may be some overtopping of local levees. For information specific
to your area, please see products issued by your local National
Weather Service forecast office.
 
Minor coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Mexico in
areas of onshore winds.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting portions of the 
coast of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas.  These swells  are 
expected to spread across the northwestern and northern Gulf of 
Mexico coastline during the next day or so.  These swells are likely 
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
