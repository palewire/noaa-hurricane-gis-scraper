DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located 
near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 76.9 West. Beryl is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this general 
motion should continue through today, followed by a turn more toward 
the west tonight or Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Beryl will pass near or over Jamaica during the next several hours. 
After that, the center is expected to pass near or over the Cayman 
Islands tonight or early Thursday and move over the Yucatan 
Peninsula of Mexico Thursday night or early Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (225 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Beryl is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some weakening is forecast during the next 
day or two.  However, Beryl is forecast to be at or near major 
hurricane intensity while it passes near Jamaica during the next 
several hours and the Cayman Islands tonight or early Thursday. 
Additional weakening is expected thereafter, though Beryl is 
forecast to remain a hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft data is 959 mb (28.32 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are about to spread into Jamaica, 
especially along the southern coast and in the mountainous areas. 
Tropical storm conditions are spreading across Jamaica at this time, 
making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains
are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be
even greater.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the Cayman Islands
tonight or early Thursday.  Winds are expected to first reach
tropical storm strength late this afternoon, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area on
the Yucatan Peninsula Thursday night or early Friday morning.  Winds
are expected to first reach tropical storm strength by late
Thursday, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area
along the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula as early as late
Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area along the southwestern peninsula of Haiti today, and in the
tropical storm warning area of the Yucatan Peninsula by late
Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm
watch area along portions of the coast of Belize by late Thursday
or early Friday, and in the tropical storm watch area along the
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula by Friday or Friday night.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 6
to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the immediate coast of Jamaica.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the immediate
coast of the Cayman Islands.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
ground level in areas of onshore winds along the southern coast of
Hispaniola.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet
above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the east coast of
the Yucatan Peninsula within the hurricane warning area.
 
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with localized amounts of 12 inches across Jamaica through
this evening, along with additional rainfall of 4 to 6 inches
over the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti. This heavy rainfall is expected
to cause life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
 
Beryl is also expected to bring rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches 
over the Cayman Islands tonight into Thursday. Over the Yucatan 
Peninsula into northern Belize, Beryl is expected to produce 
rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches with localized amounts of 8 inches 
late Thursday through Friday. Scattered instances of flash flooding 
are anticipated.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are impacting the southern
coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Jamaica, and are expected to
impact the Cayman Islands, the northern coast of Nicaragua, and the 
coast of Honduras later today.  Swells will also spread toward 
portions of western Cuba, the Yucatan Peninsula, and the coast of 
Belize during the next day or so. These swells are expected to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
