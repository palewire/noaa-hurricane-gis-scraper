            <TR><TD><B>Title:</B> Tropical Cyclone Forecast Cone of Uncertainty for AL012024 (Advisory #11A)</TD></TR>
            <TR><TD><B>Description:</B>The cone represents the probable track of the center of a tropical cyclone, and is formed by enclosing the area swept out by a set of circles along the forecast track (at 12, 24, 36 hours, etc). The size of each circle is set so that two-thirds of historical official forecast errors over a 5-year sample fall within the circle. Based on forecasts over the previous 5 years, the entire track of a tropical cyclone can be expected to remain within the cone roughly 60-70% of the time. It is important to note that the area affected by a tropical cyclone can extend well beyond the confines of the cone enclosing the most likely track area of the center. </TD></TR>
