DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Beryl was located 
near latitude 11.5 North, longitude 59.1 West. Beryl is moving 
toward the west near 20 mph (31 km/h). A continued quick westward to 
west-northwestward motion is expected during the next few days. On 
the forecast track, the center of Beryl is expected to move across 
the Windward Islands this morning and across the southeastern and 
central Caribbean Sea late today through Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Beryl is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Fluctuations in strength are likely during the 
next day or so, but Beryl is expected to remain a dangerous major 
hurricane as its core moves through the Windward Islands into the 
eastern Caribbean.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km).  Grantley Adams International Airport on Barbados 
recently reported a wind gust to 45 mph (72 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure based on Hurricane Hunter aircraft
data is 965 mb (28.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning 
area beginning early this morning.  Potentially catastrophic wind 
damage is expected where the core of Beryl moves through portions of 
the Windward Islands, with the highest risk of the core in St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada.
 
Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains 
are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds 
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be 
even greater.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area starting soon, making outside preparations difficult or 
dangerous.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area 
starting this morning for Dominica, and by Tuesday afternoon for 
parts of the southern coast of Hispaniola.
 
STORM SURGE:  A life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels
by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of
onshore winds near where the eye makes landfall in the hurricane
warning area.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Hurricane Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 
3 to 6 inches across Barbados and the Windward Islands through 
today. Localized maxima of 10 inches is possible, especially in the 
Grenadines. This rainfall may cause flash flooding in vulnerable 
areas.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are expected across Windward 
and southern Leeward Islands during the next couple of days.  Swells 
are also expected to reach the southern coasts of Puerto Rico and 
Hispaniola in the next day or so. These swells are expected to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
