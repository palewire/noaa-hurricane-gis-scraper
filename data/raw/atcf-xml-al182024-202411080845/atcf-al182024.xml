DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM CST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was located 
near latitude 24.5 North, longitude 88.0 West. Rafael is moving 
toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h), and a general westward to 
west-northwestward motion at a slower forward speed is expected 
through the weekend. On the forecast track, Rafael is expected to 
move over the central Gulf of Mexico for the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Rafael is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Some fluctuations in intensity are possible 
today. By tonight, a steady weakening trend is forecast and should 
continue through the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml

of the Gulf of Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
