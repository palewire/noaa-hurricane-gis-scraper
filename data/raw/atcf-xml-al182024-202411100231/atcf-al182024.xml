DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rafael was
located near latitude 25.7 North, longitude 91.7 West. Rafael is
moving toward the northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h). The storm is
expected to meander over the central Gulf of Mexico through Sunday 
night, then turn toward the south and south-southwest on Monday and 
Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is expected through early next week, and Rafael is 
forecast to degenerate to a post-tropical remnant low on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Rafael can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael will continue impacting portions of
the northern and western Gulf Coast through the weekend. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Rainfall indirectly associated with the moisture from 
Rafael is expected to lead to 3 to 6 inches of rain, with local 
amounts to 10 inches, across portions of Southwest and Central 
Louisiana through Sunday morning.  This rain will lead to 
potentially significant flash flooding.

 
NEXT ADVISORY
