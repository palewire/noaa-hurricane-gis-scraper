WIND:  Wind gusts to tropical-storm force are possible for the next
few hours over portions of central Mississippi and western Alabama.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to 
8 inches across portions of Mississippi, eastern Arkansas, 
Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and the Florida Panhandle. Localized 
amounts of 12 inches are possible over portions of Alabama, the 
Florida Panhandle, and Georgia. This rainfall could lead to

Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total 
Rainfall Graphic, available at

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible today across the Florida 
Panhandle, southern and central Alabama, and southwest Georgia.
