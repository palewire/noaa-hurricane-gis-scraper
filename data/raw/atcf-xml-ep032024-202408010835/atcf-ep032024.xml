moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). This motion

Friday and a continued westward motion through the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of 
days, and Carlotta is expected to become a hurricane later today or 
tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
