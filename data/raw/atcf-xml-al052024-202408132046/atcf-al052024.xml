DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was
located near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 64.1 West.  Ernesto is
moving toward the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h).  A turn 
toward the northwest with a gradual decrease in forward speed is 
expected tonight, followed by a turn toward the north-northwest and 
north Wednesday night and Thursday.  On the forecast track, the
center of Ernesto should pass near or over the Virgin Islands this
evening, and then pass just to the northeast and north of Puerto
Rico tonight and on Wednesday.  Ernesto should then move over the
western Atlantic later in the week and be near Bermuda by Friday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast, and Ernesto is expected to 
become a hurricane by tonight to the north of the Virgin Islands 
and Puerto Rico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.  A wind gust of 54 mph (87 km/h) was recently 
reported at St. Martin.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ernesto is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 4 to 6 inches over portions of the Leeward Islands
from St. Kitts and Nevis to St. Martin and across the U.S. and
British Virgin Islands. Rainfall totals of 6 to 8 inches, with
maximum amounts of 10 inches, are expected across southeastern
Puerto Rico, with totals of 2 to 4 inches across northwestern Puerto
Rico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Ernesto, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the
warning area in the northern Leeward Islands.  Tropical storm 
conditions are expected to begin spreading over the Virgin Islands 
and Puerto Rico this evening and tonight.  Hurricane conditions are 
also possible over the Virgin Islands, Vieques, and Culebra this 
evening into tonight.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level for the eastern coast of Puerto Rico
from San Juan to Guayama, including the islands of Culebra and
Vieques and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, including St. Thomas, St.
John, and St. Croix.
 
A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet
above normal tide levels in the British Virgin Islands. Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.  These swells
will then reach the Dominican Republic tonight, the Turks and Caicos
Islands and southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday, and Bermuda and the 
rest of the Bahamas on Thursday.  Swells are also expected to reach 
the east coast of the United States Thursday night and continue into 
the weekend.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
