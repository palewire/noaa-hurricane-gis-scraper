Hurricane Isaac Advisory Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
300 AM GMT Sun Sep 29 2024
 
...ISAAC CONTINUES WEAKENING...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM GMT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...42.1N 37.6W
ABOUT 625 MI...1010 KM WNW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 40 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...972 MB...28.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaac was located 
near latitude 42.1 North, longitude 37.6 West. Isaac is moving 
toward the northeast near 14 mph (22 km/h). A slower east-northeast 
to northeast motion is expected during the next couple of days, 
followed by a turn toward the north-northeast on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts, and continued weakening is expected over the next 
few days. Isaac is forecast to become a powerful post-tropical 
cyclone by Sunday night or early Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough will affect the Azores over the next few days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM GMT.
