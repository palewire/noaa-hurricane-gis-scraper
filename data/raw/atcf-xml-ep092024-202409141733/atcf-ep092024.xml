--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Altata to Huatabampito Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within
12 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Mexican states of Baja California Sur,
Sinaloa, and Sonora should closely monitor the progress of Ileana.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM MST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ileana was
located near latitude 25.2 North, longitude 108.9 West. Ileana is
moving toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue today.  A slower motion toward the
north-northwest and northwest is expected tonight and on Sunday.  On
the forecast track, the center of Ileana will move near or over the
coasts of northern Sinaloa and southern Sonora during the next 
several hours, and then move over the Gulf of California roughly 
parallel to the coast on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Weakening is forecast to begin later this afternoon or
evening, and Ileana is likely to degenerate into a remnant low
tonight.  The remnant low is expected to dissipate by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.  The Mexican Navy station at Topolobampo recently 
reported sustained winds of 31 mph (50 km/h) and a wind gust of   
40 mph (65 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).

afternoon.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ileana will affect portions of the
Gulf of California coasts of Sinaloa, southern Sonora, and southern
Baja California Sur during the next day or so.  These swells could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
