DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK

At 500 PM HST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gilma was
located near latitude 18.5 North, longitude 143.3 West. Gilma is
moving toward the west near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A motion between

the forecast track the remnants of Gilma should approach the 
Hawaiian Islands on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued steady to rapid weakening is expected, 
and Gilma is expected to weaken to a remnant low Thursday or 
Thursday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

RAINFALL: The remnants of Gilma may bring heavy rainfall to
portions of the Hawaiian Islands as early as Friday, lasting
through Saturday.
 
SURF: Easterly swell generated by Gilma will build over waters
around the Hawaiian Islands today and tonight. These swells may
produce high surf along east-facing shores of some islands from
Wednesday into Friday.
