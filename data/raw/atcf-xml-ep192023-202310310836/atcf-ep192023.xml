SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Entire coast of El Salvador
* Pacific coast of Honduras including the Gulf of Fonseca
* Honduras/Nicaragua border southward to Puerto Sandino
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are

Interests elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Nicaragua and in
southern Guatemala should monitor the progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 11.4 North, longitude 90.4 West. Pilar is
moving toward the east-northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue today.  On the forecast 
track, Pilar could be approaching the coast of El Salvador or 
Nicaragua late today through early Wednesday, though the core of 
the system is expected to remain offshore.  The storm is forecast 
to begin moving west-southwestward away from land by Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Pilar could intensify some over the next day or two before 
gradual weakening likely begins on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, over portions of
Central America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica through
Wednesday.  This rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding,
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical Storm
Watch areas this morning.
