DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was 
located near latitude 24.0 North, longitude 96.0 West. Francine is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A continued 
north-northwest motion is expected through this evening followed by 
a turn to the northeast with some acceleration beginning Tuesday. 
On the forecast track, Francine is anticipated to be just offshore 
of the coasts of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas through 
Tuesday, and nearing the Louisiana and Upper Texas coastline on 
Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Significant strengthening is forecast over the 
next couple of days, and Francine is expected to become a hurricane 
tonight or Tuesday morning. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Francine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area on 
Wednesday. Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch 
area on Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions expected by 
Wednesday morning within the warning areas.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area along
the northern coast of Mexico tonight and could spread along the 
Texas coast on Tuesday and Tuesday night.  Tropical storm 
conditions are possible in the watch area in eastern Louisiana on 
Wednesday.

RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to 
8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches, from the coast of  
northeast Mexico northward over the far lower and far upper Texas 
coasts, across southern Louisiana, and southern Mississippi into 
Thursday morning. This rainfall could lead to the risk of 
considerable flash and urban flooding. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Storm Francine, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cameron, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
High Island, TX to Cameron, LA...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA to MS/AL Border...2-4 ft
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to High Island, TX...1-3 ft
Galveston Bay...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances. Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees. However, there
may be some overtopping of local levees. For information specific
to your area, please see products issued by your local National
Weather Service forecast office.
 
Minor coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Mexico in
areas of onshore winds.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting portions of the
coast of northeastern Mexico and are expected to spread 
across the northwestern Gulf of Mexico coastline during the next 
day or two.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your 
local weather office.
