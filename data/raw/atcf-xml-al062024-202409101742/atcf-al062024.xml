DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was
located near latitude 25.3 North, longitude 95.2 West. Francine is
moving toward the northeast near 9 mph (14 km/h).  A continued 
northeastward motion and a faster forward speed are expected later
this afternoon and tonight.  On the forecast track, Francine is 
anticipated to move away from the coast of northeastern Mexico and 
south Texas this afternoon, move across the northwestern Gulf of 
Mexico tonight, and then make landfall in Louisiana on Wednesday.  
After landfall, the center is expected to move into Mississippi on 
Wednesday night or Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is expected through Wednesday morning, and
Francine will likely become a hurricane later today or tonight.
Francine is expected to weaken quickly after landfall.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Reserve
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Francine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area on Wednesday. with tropical storm conditions arriving
in the warning area by early Wednesday.
 
Tropical Storm conditions are expected in the warning area along 
the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi Wednesday and 
Wednesday night. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the 
watch area along the Texas coast tonight and Wednesday, and they 
are also possible in the watch area on the Alabama coast on 
Wednesday and Wednesday night.  Wind gusts to tropical-storm force 
could occur along portions of the coasts of South Texas and 
northeastern Mexico this afternoon.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to
8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across much of Louisiana
and Mississippi through Friday morning. This rainfall could lead to
considerable flash and urban flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
Sabine Pass, TX to Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, LA...3-5 ft
Pointe a la Hache, LA to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft
Lake Pontchartrain...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible Wednesday morning through
Wednesday night over near-coastal areas of Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting portions of the
coast of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas.  These swells are
expected to spread across the northwestern and northern Gulf of
Mexico coastline during the next day or so.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
