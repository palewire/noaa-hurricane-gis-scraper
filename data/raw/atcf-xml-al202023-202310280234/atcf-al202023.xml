DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Tammy was 
located near latitude 32.7 North, longitude 61.3 West. Tammy is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A turn toward 
the north and northeast is expected through early Saturday, followed 
by a faster eastward to east-southeastward motion on Sunday and 
Monday. On the forecast track, Tammy will move away from Bermuda on 
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Weakening is expected during the next few days, and 
Tammy is forecast to become a post-tropical remnant low early next 
week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect Bermuda
through Saturday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.
