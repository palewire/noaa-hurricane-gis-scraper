DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM MST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ileana was
located near latitude 20.5 North, longitude 108.2 West. Ileana is
moving toward the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this
motion is expected to continue through Friday. A turn to the north
at a slightly slower forward speed is expected Friday night. On the
forecast track, the center of Ileana should pass near or over the
southern portion of Baja California Sur Friday and Friday night
before emerging over the southern Gulf of California by early 
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some strengthening is expected before the storm reaches Baja 
California Sur. After that, gradual weakening is forecast while the 
cyclone is near or over land.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ileana can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ileana is expected to produce 4-6 inches
with localized higher amounts up to 8 inches across the coastal
areas of Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco through early Friday. From
Friday through Sunday, Tropical Storm Ileana may result in 4-6
inches, with localized higher amounts up to 8 inches, across
southern Baja California. For northwest coastal Sinaloa, Tropical
Storm Ileana may produce between 6-8 inches with localized higher
amounts up to 12 inches. This heavy rainfall will bring a risk of
flash flooding and mudslides to portions of the area.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach
the coast of the southern Baja California Peninsula within the
warning area Friday morning, making outside preparations difficult
or dangerous. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the
watch area by early Saturday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Ileana will affect portions 
of the coast of west-central Mexico and the coast of the southern 
Baja California Peninsula during the next couple of days. These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
