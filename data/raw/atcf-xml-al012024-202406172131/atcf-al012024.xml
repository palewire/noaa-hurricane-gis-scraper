DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------

20.3 North, longitude 93.2 West. The system is moving toward the
north-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h) and this general motion is 
expected to continue through Tuesday.  A turn toward the 
west-northwest is expected Tuesday night or Wednesday, and system 
is likely to approach the western Gulf coast late Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some slow strengthening is possible, and the disturbance is 
forecast to become a tropical storm by Wednesday.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.
 
The disturbance is quite large with tropical-storm-force winds 
extending outward up to 290 miles (465 km) to the northeast of the 
center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone One can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.

RAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone One is expected to 
produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico 
into South Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible.  This 
rainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding along with 
new and renewed river flooding.  Mudslides are also possible in 
areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone One, please see the 
National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Sargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft
Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft
Sabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.

In Mexico, minor coastal flooding is possible north of where the 
center of the disturbance crosses the coast in areas of onshore 
winds.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by Wednesday.
