DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Oscar was
located near latitude 20.2 North, longitude 75.3 West.  Oscar is
moving toward the west near 2 mph (4 km/h).  A turn to the northwest
and north is expected later today, followed by a faster
northeastward motion on Tuesday and Wednesday.  On the forecast
track, the center of Oscar is expected to continue moving across
eastern Cuba through this afternoon, then emerge off the northern
coast of Cuba late today or tonight and move near the southeastern
and central Bahamas on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Some additional weakening could occur while Oscar 
moves across the mountainous terrain of eastern Cuba, but Oscar is 
forecast to be a tropical storm when it moves north of Cuba late 
today and then moves near the southeastern and central Bahamas on 
Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
