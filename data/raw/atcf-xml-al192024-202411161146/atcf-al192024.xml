DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Sara was
located near latitude 16.1 North, longitude 86.3 West. Sara is
nearly stationary. A slow west-northwestward motion is
forecast to begin late today, with a faster motion toward the
west-northwest and northwest expected on Sunday and Sunday night. On
the forecast track, the center of Sara will continue to move near
the northern coast of Honduras during the next day or so before
approaching Belize, and then move onshore in Belize during the day
on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is likely today. Slight
strengthening is possible tonight and Sunday before landfall in
Belize, with weakening expected after landfall. Sara is expected to
dissipate Sunday night or Monday as it crosses the southern portion
of the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).

Guatemala, western Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo,
Tropical Storm Sara is expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain
with localized totals around 15 inches through early next week. This
will result in areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along
with the potential of mudslides.
