DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM CST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Sara 
was located near latitude 17.4 North, longitude 89.0 West. Sara is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A turn 
northwestward with some increase in forward speed is expected 
through tonight. On the forecast track, the center of Sara will move 
further inland over the Yucatan Peninsula today before it opens up 
into a trough by tonight or tomorrow.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Weakening is forecast to continue as the depression 
moves further inland, and Sara is expected to become a remnant low 
before it opens up into a trough over the southern portion of the 
Yucatan Peninsula tonight or on Monday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Tropical Depression Sara can be found in the 
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO 
header WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at 
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are expected
over northern Honduras, with storm total amounts locally as high as
40 inches. The risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flooding
impacts will continue, especially along and near the Sierra La
Esperanza.
 
Across portions of Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala, western 
Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo, Tropical 
Depression Sara is expected to produce an additional 3 to 5 inches 
of rain with localized storm totals around 15 inches. This will 
result in areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along with 
the potential of mudslides.
