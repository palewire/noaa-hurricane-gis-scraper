DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM CST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane John was located 
near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 98.4 West. John is moving toward 
the north near 3 mph (6 km/h). A slow motion to the north-northeast 
or northeast is expected for the next couple of days.  On the 
forecast track, the center of the system is forecast to approach the 
southern coast of Mexico tonight, and move inland on Tuesday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast, and John is expected to
become a major hurricane before the center reaches the coast of 
southern Mexico on Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles
(75 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).

 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for John can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Through Thursday, John is expected to produce 6 to 12
inches of rain with isolated totals around 15 inches across the
coastal areas of Chiapas.  In areas along and near the Oaxaca coast
to southeast Guerrero, between 10 and 20 inches of rain with
isolated totals near 30 inches can be expected through Thursday.
This heavy rainfall will likely cause significant and possibly
catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides to the
Mexican States of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and southeast Guerrero,
particularly in areas near the coast.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane John, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the hurricane warning area tonight or early Tuesday morning.  Winds 
are expected to first reach tropical storm strength later today, 
making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to 
protect life and property should be rushed to completion.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the coast
within the tropical storm warning area early Tuesday.
 
SURF:  Swells associated with John are forecast to continue
affecting the coast of southern Mexico during the next couple of
days, with the potential for dangerous surf and rip currents much of
the week.  Please see local statements for more information.
