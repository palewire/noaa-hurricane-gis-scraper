DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter near latitude 26.3 
North, longitude 95.3 West. Beryl is moving toward the north- 
northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  This general motion is expected 
to continue through tonight, with a turn toward the north forecast 
on Monday. On the forecast track, the center of Beryl is expected 
to make landfall on the middle Texas coast early Monday. Beryl is 
forecast to turn northeastward and move farther inland over eastern 
Texas and Arkansas late Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Steady strengthening is expected, and Beryl is forecast to 
become a hurricane again later today.  Continued strengthening is 
expected overnight before Beryl reaches the Texas coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.29 inches) 
based on Air Force data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the NHC website at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area by early Monday.  Winds are first expected to reach tropical
storm strength by late today, making outdoor preparations difficult
or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch areas by
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions beginning by tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm
warning areas in south Texas starting within the next few hours.

Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm 
warning area along the upper Texas coast early Monday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mesquite Bay, TX to San Luis Pass, TX...4-6 ft
Matagorda Bay...4-6 ft
San Luis Pass, TX to Sabine Pass, TX... 3-5 ft
N Entrance Padre Island NS, TX to Mesquite Bay, TX...3-5 ft
Galveston Bay...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches with localized amounts
of 15 inches is expected across portions of the middle and upper
Texas Gulf Coast and eastern Texas beginning today through Monday
night. This rainfall will produce areas of flash and urban flooding,
some of which may be locally considerable. Minor to isolated
moderate river flooding is also expected.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Beryl, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes could occur along the middle and upper
Texas Coast through tonight, and across eastern Texas and western
Louisiana on Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Beryl are expected to affect eastern
Mexico and much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. during the next day
or two.  These swells are expected to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
