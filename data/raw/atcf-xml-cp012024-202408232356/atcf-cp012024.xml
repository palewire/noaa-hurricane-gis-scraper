DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM HST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hone was
located by US Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft and 
satellite near latitude 16.8 North, longitude 148.6 West. Hone is 
moving toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h). This motion toward the 
west is expected to continue over the next several days as the 
forward speed gradually slows. On the forecast track, the center of 
Hone is expected to pass near or south of the Big Island Saturday 
night into early Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 to 72
hours.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Hone can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header TCDCP1 and WMO
header WTPA41 PHFO, and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/HFOTCDCP1.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area
late Saturday into Sunday. Winds are expected to be strongest
where they blow downslope from higher terrain, over headlands, and
through passes.
 
RAINFALL: Hone is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches over mainly windward and southeast facing slopes of the
Big Island, with locally higher amounts. Rainfall totals of 2 to 4
inches will be possible over portions of the smaller islands,
mainly windward.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Hone are expected to
begin reaching the Hawaiian Islands over the weekend. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.
