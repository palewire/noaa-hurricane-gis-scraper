DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was 
located near latitude 18.8 North, longitude 65.3 West. Ernesto is 
moving toward the northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h). A turn toward the 
north-northwest and north with a gradual decrease in forward speed 
is expected on Wednesday night and Thursday. On the forecast track, 
the center of Ernesto will pass to the northeast and north of Puerto 
Rico through early Wednesday. Ernesto should then move over the 
western Atlantic later in the week and approach Bermuda on Friday 
and Friday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next several days, and 
Ernesto is expected to become a hurricane by early Wednesday to the 
north of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center. Henry E. Rohlsen Airport in St. Croix recently 
reported a sustained wind of 36 mph (57 km/h) and a gust of 58 mph 
(93 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).

WIND: Tropical storm conditions will continue spreading across the
Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Vieques, and Culebra through the
overnight hours. Hurricane conditions are possible in portions of
the watch area during the next several hours.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level for the eastern coast of Puerto Rico
from San Juan to Guayama, including the islands of Culebra and
Vieques and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, including St. Thomas, St.
John, and St. Croix.
 
A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet
above normal tide levels in the British Virgin Islands. Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. These swells
will reach the Dominican Republic overnight, the Turks and Caicos
Islands and southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday, and Bermuda and the
rest of the Bahamas on Thursday. Swells are expected to reach the
east coast of the United States Thursday night and continue into the
weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
