DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was
located near latitude 16.2 North, longitude 61.3 West. Ernesto is
moving toward the west near 20 mph (31 km/h).  A west-northwestward
motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected during the
next day or so.  On the forecast track, Ernesto is expected to move
across portions of the Leeward Islands this morning and near or
over the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by this
evening.  After passing Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, Ernesto 
is forecast to turn northward over the western Atlantic.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is expected during the next few days, and
Ernesto could reach hurricane strength by Thursday over the waters
north of the Greater Antilles.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.  St. Barthelemy recently reported a wind gust of 
53 mph (85 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface
observations in the Leeward Islands is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).

Elsewhere in the Caribbean, Tropical Storm Ernesto is expected to

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
for the Leeward Islands beginning during the next few hours.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin spreading over the
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by this evening.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level for the eastern coast of Puerto Rico
from San Juan to Guayama, including the islands of Culebra and
Vieques and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, including St. Thomas, St.
John, and St. Croix.
 
A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet
above normal tide levels in the British Virgin Islands. Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto will likely begin to affect
portions of the Leeward Islands beginning in the next several
hours.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
