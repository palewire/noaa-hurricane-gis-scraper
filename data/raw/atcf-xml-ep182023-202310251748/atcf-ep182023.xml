At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Otis was 
located near latitude 18.6 North, longitude 100.7 West.  Otis is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected through early tonight.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Otis will continue to move farther inland over
southern Mexico later today and tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Continued rapid weakening is expected while Otis
moves farther inland over the mountains of Mexico.  Otis will likely
dissipate over southern Mexico tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) 
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (28.38 inches).
