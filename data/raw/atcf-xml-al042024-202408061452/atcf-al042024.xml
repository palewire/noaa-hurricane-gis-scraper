HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
tropical storm warning area along the Georgia coast for the next 
few hours.  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue along
the coast of South Carolina within the tropical storm warning area
through Thursday night.  Tropical storm conditions are expected 
within the tropical storm warning area in North Carolina beginning
early Wednesday.  Tropical Storm conditions are possible within the 
Tropical Storm Watch area in North Carolina beginning Wednesday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Altamaha Sound, GA to Cape Fear, NC...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce potentially historic rainfall 
totals of 10 to 20 inches, with maximum amounts of 25 inches, 
bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of the 
eastern half of South Carolina, and southeast North Carolina through 
Friday.

From northern North Carolina through portions of the Mid-Atlantic 
States, 4 to 8 inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 12 inches, 
are expected through Sunday morning. This rainfall will likely 
result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with river 
flooding possible.  

An additional scattered 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, with maximum 
amounts of 4 inches is possible across western portion of the 
Central Florida Peninsula and southeast Georgia today which may 
aggravate any ongoing flooding conditions across that vicinity.  
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with  Debby, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk

TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over coastal South Carolina 
and coastal southeast North Carolina today through Wednesday
