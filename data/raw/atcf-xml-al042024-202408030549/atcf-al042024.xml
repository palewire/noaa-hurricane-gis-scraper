DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Four was 
located near latitude 21.6 North, longitude 80.1 West. The 
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 17 mph (28 
km/h). A turn toward the northwest is forecast today, followed by a 
slower motion toward the north and then the northeast on Sunday and 
Monday. On the forecast track, the center of the depression will 
move across Cuba this morning, and then move generally northward 
over the eastern Gulf of Mexico later today and Sunday, potentially 
reaching the Florida Gulf coast late Sunday or Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is forecast during the next several days, and the 
depression is expected to become a tropical storm later today and 
continue strengthening over the eastern Gulf of Mexico through the 
weekend.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1010 mb (29.83 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for the depression can be found in the Tropical Cyclone 
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.

WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area 
later today and tonight. Tropical storm conditions are possible in 
the watch area in the Florida Keys and the southern Florida 
peninsula later today or tonight. Tropical storm conditions are 
possible in the watch area along the Florida west coast tonight and 
Sunday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Bonita Beach, FL to Suwannee River, FL...2-4 ft
Tampa Bay...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Card Sound Bridge, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...1-3 ft
Dry Tortugas...1-2 ft
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Four is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 4 to 8 inches, with maximum rainfall totals up to 12
inches, across portions of Florida and along the Southeast U.S.
coast this weekend through Wednesday. This rainfall may result in
areas of locally considerable flash and urban flooding, with
isolated river flooding possible.
 
For Cuba, rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches, with localized higher 
amounts, will be possible through today. This may result in isolated 
to scattered areas of flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Depression Four, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf
