DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 15.6 North, longitude 69.9 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 22 mph (35 km/h), and this general
motion should continue through Wednesday, followed by a turn more
toward the west on Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Beryl will move quickly across the central Caribbean Sea today and
is forecast to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday and the Cayman Islands
on Thursday.  The center is forecast to approach the Yucatan
Peninsula of Mexico on Thursday night.
 
Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 155 mph (250 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Beryl is a category 4 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is forecast later
today, but Beryl is still expected to be near major hurricane
intensity as it moves into the central Caribbean and passes near
Jamaica on Wednesday and the Cayman Islands on Thursday. Additional
weakening is expected thereafter, though Beryl is forecast to remain
a hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane
Hunter aircraft data is 943 mb (27.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast of
Jamaica within the warning area on Wednesday.  Winds are expected to
first reach tropical storm strength early on Wednesday, making
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along the
south coast of Hispaniola later today.
 
Hurricane conditions could begin on Thursday across the Cayman
Islands.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 5
to 8 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the immediate coast of Jamaica.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet
above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the
immediate coast of the Cayman Islands.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
ground level in areas of onshore winds along the southern coast of
Hispaniola.
 
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Hurricane Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of
4 to 8 inches, with localized maxima of 12 inches, across Jamaica
and the southwestern Haitian Peninsula through late Wednesday. Beryl
will also produce rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches with isolated
amounts of 10 inches across the Barahona Peninsula in southwest
Dominican Republic. Isolated totals of 6 inches or more are also
anticipated across the mountainous terrain in the central Dominican
Republic. This rainfall is likely to cause flash flooding and
mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl will continue across the 
Windward and southern Leeward Islands during the next day or so. 
Swells will impact the southern coasts of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola 
through midweek. These swells are expected to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your 
local weather office.
