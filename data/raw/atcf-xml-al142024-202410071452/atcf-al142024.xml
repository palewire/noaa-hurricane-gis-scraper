DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Milton was
located near latitude 21.7 North, longitude 91.7 West. Milton is
moving toward the east-southeast near 9 mph (15 km/h). An eastward 
to east-southeastward motion is forecast through tonight, followed 
by a turn toward the east and northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday.  
On the forecast track, Milton is forecast to move near or just 
north of the Yucatan Peninsula today and Tuesday, then cross the 
eastern Gulf of Mexico and approach the west coast of the Florida 
Peninsula by Wednesday.
 
Data from NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 
155 mph (250 km/h) with higher gusts.  Milton is a category 4 
hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Milton is 
forecast to become a category 5 hurricane later today and become a 
large hurricane over the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 933 mb (27.55 inches) 
based on Air Force Reserve dropsonde data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Hurricane Milton can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 4
to 6 feet above ground level along the northern coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in areas of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Anclote River, FL to Englewood, FL...8-12 ft
Tampa Bay...8-12 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Anclote River, FL...5-10 ft
Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...5-10 ft
Charlotte Harbor...5-10 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...4-7 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches, with localized totals
up to 15 inches, are expected across portions of the Florida
Peninsula and the Keys through Wednesday night. This rainfall brings
the risk of considerable flash, urban, and areal flooding, along
with the potential for moderate to major river flooding.
 
Milton will also produce rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with 
isolated totals around 6 inches across northern portions of the 
Yucatan Peninsula.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area in
Mexico beginning late today or tonight, with tropical storm
conditions expected to begin early this afternoon. Hurricane
conditions are possible in the watch areas in Mexico beginning 
tonight and Tuesday, and tropical storm conditions are expected in 
the tropical storm warning area beginning later today. Hurricane 
conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch area in Florida on 
Wednesday, and tropical storm conditions are possible in the 
Tropical Storm Watch area on Wednesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the system are expected to continue 
to affect much of the whole Gulf Coast within the next day or two, 
and are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
