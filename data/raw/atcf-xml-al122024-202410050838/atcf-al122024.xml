DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located 
near latitude 26.2 North, longitude 50.2 West. Kirk is moving toward 
the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A turn to the north is 
expected today, followed by a faster northeastward motion on Sunday 
and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Kirk is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Weakening is forecast through early next week, 
but Kirk will remain a large hurricane for the next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 945 mb (27.91 inches).

Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles. These swells are expected to
spread westward to the east coast of the United States, Atlantic
Canada, and the Bahamas Saturday night and Sunday, and to the Azores
on Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
