DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was located 
near latitude 24.7 North, longitude 86.2 West. Rafael is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A turn toward the 
west is expected tonight, with this general motion at a slightly 
slower forward speed continuing through the weekend. On the forecast 
track, Rafael is expected to move over the southern Gulf of Mexico 
for the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Some small intensity fluctuations are possible 
tonight. Weakening is forecast to begin on Friday and continue 
through the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to spread across most
of the Gulf of Mexico during the next several days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
