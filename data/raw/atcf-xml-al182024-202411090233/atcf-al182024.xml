WATCHES AND WARNINGS

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rafael was
located near latitude 24.8 North, longitude 89.9 West. Rafael is
moving toward the west-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A slow 
west-northwestward motion is expected through Saturday. After 
that, Rafael is likely to move slowly south-southwestward toward 
the southwestern Gulf of Mexico through early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional steady to rapid weakening is 
expected during the next few days.  During the past few hours, NOAA 
buoy 42001 located north of the center reported sustained winds of 
42 mph (68 km/h) and a wind gust of 51 mph (83 km/h).
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to spread across most
of the Gulf of Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
