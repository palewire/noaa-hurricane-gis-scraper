DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was
located near latitude 25.7 North, longitude 95.0 West. Francine is
moving toward the northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A continued
northeastward motion and a faster forward speed are expected 
tonight and Wednesday.  On the forecast track, Francine is
anticipated to move across the northwestern Gulf of Mexico tonight, 
and then make landfall in Louisiana on Wednesday or Wednesday 
night. After landfall, the center is expected to move northward 
into Mississippi on Wednesday night or Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is expected through Wednesday morning, and
Francine will likely become a hurricane tonight. Francine is 
expected to weaken quickly after landfall.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Francine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area on Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions arriving
in the warning area by early Wednesday. Hurricane conditions are 
possible in the Hurricane Watch area Wednesday and Wednesday night.
 
Tropical Storm conditions are expected in the warning area along
the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama Wednesday 
and Wednesday night.
 
RAINFALL:  Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 
to 8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across eastern 
Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama and the western
Florida Panhandle through Friday morning. This rainfall could lead
to considerable flash and urban flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft 
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft 
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft 
Cameron, LA to Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, LA...3-5 ft 
Pointe a la Hache, LA to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft 
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible Wednesday into Wednesday 
night across parts of southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi, 
southern Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting much of 
the northwestern Gulf Coast.  These swells are expected to spread 
across the remainder of the northern Gulf of Mexico coastline 
during the next day or so.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
