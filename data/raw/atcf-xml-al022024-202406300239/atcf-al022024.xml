DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located 
near latitude 10.4 North, longitude 51.2 West. Beryl is moving 
quickly toward the west near 20 mph (31 km/h). A continued quick 
westward to west-northwestward motion is expected during the next 
few days. On the forecast track, the center of Beryl is expected to 
move across the Windward Islands late Sunday night and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast over the next 
day or so, and Beryl is expected to become a dangerous major 
hurricane before it reaches the Windward Islands.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area beginning Sunday night. Devastating wind damage is expected
where the eyewall of Beryl moves through portions of the Windward
Islands.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area starting Sunday night, making outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area starting Sunday night.
 
Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains
are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be
even greater.
 
STORM SURGE:  A life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels 
by as much as 5 to 7 feet above normal tide levels in areas of 
onshore flow near where Beryl makes landfall in the hurricane 
warning area.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by 
large and destructive waves.

RAINFALL:  Hurricane Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 
3 to 6 inches across Barbados and the Windward Islands Sunday night 
into Monday. This rainfall may cause flooding in vulnerable areas.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Beryl are expected to reach the Windward
and southern Leeward Islands by late Sunday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
