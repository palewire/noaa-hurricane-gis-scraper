DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located near latitude 24.9 North, longitude 83.9 West.  Debby is
moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A turn toward
the north is expected later today, followed by a slower motion 
toward the northeast on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, 
the center will move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico through 
tonight and reach the Florida Big Bend coast Monday morning.  The
center is then expected to move slowly across northern Florida and
southern Georgia Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is forecast, and Debby is expected to become a 
hurricane by tonight before it reaches the Florida Big Bend coast.  
Weakening is expected on Monday and Tuesday after Debby moves 
inland.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.  Wind gusts of 45 mph (72 km/h) and 41 mph (67
km/h) were recently reported at Sand Key and the Key West Naval Air 
Station in the Florida Keys, respectively.
 
The minimum central pressure is estimated to be 1003 mb (29.62 
inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area and possible in the hurricane watch areas on Monday, with
tropical storm conditions expected to arrive this evening.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread northward over the
tropical storm warning areas through tonight. Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the watch area in the Florida Keys
during the next several hours, and in the Florida Panhandle on 
Monday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Suwannee River to Aucilla River, FL...6-10 ft
Yankeetown to Suwannee River, FL ...4-7 ft
Aucilla River to Ochlockonee River, FL...4-6 ft
Aripeka to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
Ochlockonee River to Indian Pass, FL...3-5 ft
Bonita Beach to Aripeka, FL...2-4 ft
Tampa Bay...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Debby is expected to produce rainfall 
totals of 10 to 20 inches, with maximum rainfall totals towards 30 
inches, across portions of northern Florida and along the Southeast 
U.S. coast through Friday morning. This rainfall will likely result 
in areas of severe and widespread  flash and urban flooding, with 
significant river flooding expected.

For Cuba, additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches, with 
localized higher amounts, will be possible through Sunday morning. 
This will result in isolated to scattered areas of flooding.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Tropical Storm Debby, please see the National 
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero

graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two is possible across the Florida Keys and
the southern and western parts of the Florida Peninsula overnight, 
expanding across much of northern and central Florida later today.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the 
Gulf coast of Florida through Monday.  Swells will begin to affect 
the Southeast U.S. coast on Monday and continue through the middle 
of the week. These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your 
local weather office.
