DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM MST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nine-E
was located near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 107.7 West. The
depression is moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A 
northwestward to north-northwestward motion is expected through 
early Friday, followed by a turn toward the north and a slight 
decrease in forward speed by Friday night. On the forecast track, 
the center of the cyclone should pass near or over Baja California 
Sur Friday or Friday night before emerging over the southern Gulf of 
California late Friday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some strengthening is forecast during the next 24 to 36
hours, and the depression is forecast to strengthen to a tropical
storm later today.  After that, slight additional strengthening is
possible before the system reaches the southern Baja California
peninsula.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for the depression can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Nine-E is expected to produce 4-6
inches of rain with localized higher amounts up to 8 inches across
the coastal areas of Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco through early
Friday. From Friday through Sunday, the system is forecast to
produce 4-6 inches of rain, with localized higher amounts up to 8
inches, across southern Baja California. For northwest coastal
Sinaloa, the system may produce between 6-8 inches of rain with
localized higher amounts up to 12 inches.  This heavy rainfall will
bring a risk of flash flooding and mudslides to portions of the
area.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach
the coast of the southern Baja California Peninsula within the
warning area by early Friday, making outside preparations difficult
or dangerous. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the
watch area by late Friday night or early Saturday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Depression Nine-E will affect
portions of the coast of west-central Mexico during the next day or
so, and will spread northward along the coasts of the southern Baja
California Peninsula and mainland Mexico beginning tonight. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
