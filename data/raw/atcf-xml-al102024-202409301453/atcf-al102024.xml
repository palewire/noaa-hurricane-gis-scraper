DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Isaac 
was located near latitude 44.8 North, longitude 29.1 West. The 
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near 17 
mph (28 km/h) and a turn to the northeast is expected with a similar 
forward motion for the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast over the next
several days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac will affect the Azores over the
next few days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
