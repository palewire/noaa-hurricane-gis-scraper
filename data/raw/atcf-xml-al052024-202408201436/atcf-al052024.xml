DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone

The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the northeast near 37 mph

during the next day or two.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some weakening is expected tonight and on Wednesday, and 
post-tropical Ernesto is forecast to merge with a frontal system and 
dissipate by late Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by post-tropical Ernesto are affecting the
northeast coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada. The swells
and associated life-threatening surf and rip current conditions
should gradually subside during the next day or so. Please consult
products from your local weather office, and stay out of the water
if advised by lifeguards.
