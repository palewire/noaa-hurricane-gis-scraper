DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK

At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Oscar was
located near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 75.1 West. Oscar is
moving toward the north-northeast near 9 mph (14 km/h). A faster
northeastward motion is expected later today and on Wednesday. On 
the forecast track, the center of Oscar is expected to move near the
southeastern and central Bahamas later today.
 
Data from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that 
maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of 
days, and Oscar could degenerate to a post-tropical low by tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
east and northeast of the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft data is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
