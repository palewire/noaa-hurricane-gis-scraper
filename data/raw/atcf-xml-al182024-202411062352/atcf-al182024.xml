DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM EST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was located
near latitude 23.2 North, longitude 83.2 West. Rafael is moving
toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A general northwestward
motion is anticipated tonight.  A slower west-northwestward to
westward motion is expected Friday through the weekend.  On the
forecast track, Rafael is expected to move away from western Cuba 
this evening, and move over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico this 
evening and tonight.  Rafael is then forecast to move over the 
southern Gulf of Mexico for the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (170 km/h) with higher
gusts. Rafael is a category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Little change in strength is expected during 
the next day or so while Rafael moves over the southeastern Gulf of 
Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km).  Wind gusts to tropical-storm force are occurring 
in squalls over the Lower and Middle Florida Keys, including a gust 
of 66 mph (106 km/h) at the NOAA station at Sand Key.
 
The minimum central pressure based on NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft data is 966 mb (28.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to continue in portions of 
western Cuba for the next few hours.  Tropical storm conditions 
are expected in parts of west-central Cuba and the lower and middle 
Florida Keys through tonight.
 
RAINFALL: Heavy rainfall will impact areas of the western Caribbean
through early Thursday, particularly across the Cayman Islands and
western Cuba.  Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are expected across
portions of western Cuba, with isolated higher totals up to 12
inches in areas of higher terrain. This will lead to areas of flash
flooding and mudslides. Across the Cayman Islands additional
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected.
 
Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected for the Lower and
Middle Florida Keys.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Rafael, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge flooding along the coast of Cuba should 
subside tonight.
 
The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally
dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving
inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the following
heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Lower Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
TORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes are possible through tonight over
the Florida Keys and far southwestern Florida mainland.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to affect much of the
western Caribbean during the next day or so and will also spread
across most of the Gulf of Mexico from east to west late this week
into the weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
