DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm John was
located near latitude 14.5 North, longitude 98.5 West. John is
moving toward the north-northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A slow
motion to the north-northeast or northeast is expected for the next
couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of the system is
forecast to approach the southern coast of Mexico during the next
day or two and move inland on Tuesday or Tuesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  John is forecast to strengthen as it approaches 
the coast of southern Mexico, and the chances of it becoming a 
hurricane before landfall are increasing.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for John can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Through Thursday, John is expected to produce 6 to 12
inches of rain with isolated totals around 15 inches across the
coastal areas of Chiapas.  In areas along and near the Oaxaca coast
to southeast Guerrero, between 10 and 20 inches of rain with
isolated totals near 30 inches can be expected through Thursday.
This heavy rainfall will likely cause significant and possibly
catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides to the
Mexican States of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and southeast Guerrero,
particularly in areas near the coast.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm John, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep10.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the hurricane warning area early Tuesday.  Winds are expected to 
first reach tropical storm strength tonight, making outside 
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life 
and property should be rushed to completion.

Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the coast 
within the tropical storm warning area on Tuesday.
 
SURF:  Swells associated with John are forecast to begin
to affect the coast of southern Mexico later today, with the
potential for dangerous surf and rip currents much of the week.
Please see local statements for more information.
