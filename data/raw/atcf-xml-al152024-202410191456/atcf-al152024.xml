DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nadine was
located near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 87.9 West.  Nadine is
moving toward the west near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A faster westward 
motion is expected during the next day or so.  On the forecast 
track, Nadine is expected to make landfall near Belize City later 
this morning, and then move across Belize, northern Guatemala, and 
southern Mexico this afternoon through Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Weakening is expected after the storm moves 
inland, and it will likely dissipate by late Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
