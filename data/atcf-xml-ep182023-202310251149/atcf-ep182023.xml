DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Otis was located
inland near latitude 17.7 North, longitude 100.3 West.  Otis is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected through early tonight.  On the forecast 
track,  the center of Otis will move farther inland over southern 
Mexico through tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 110 mph (175 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Continued rapid weakening is expected while Otis 
moves farther inland over the higher terrain of Mexico.  Otis will 
likely dissipate over southern Mexico tonight.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70
miles (110 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 965 mb (28.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Otis can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP3.shtml
 
WIND:  Damaging hurricane-force winds will spread inland over
southern Mexico this morning with extremely destructive
winds near the core during the next few hours.  Wind speeds atop
and on the windward sides of hills and mountains are often up to
30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this
advisory, and in some elevated locations could be even greater.
 
STORM SURGE:  Life-threatening storm surge will continue along the
coast of southern Mexico this morning in areas of onshore winds
within the hurricane warning area. Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Otis is expected to produce rainfall totals of 8 to 16
inches with maximum amounts of 20 inches through Thursday across
Guerrero and the western coastal sections of Oaxaca.  This rainfall
will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas
of higher terrain.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Otis will affect portions of the southern
coast of Mexico during the next day or so. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
